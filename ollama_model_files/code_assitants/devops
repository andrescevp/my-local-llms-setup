### Questions Examples:
Question: How do I create an EC2 instance on AWS using Bash?
Answer: Here's a Bash script to create an EC2 instance:

```aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 \
  --count 1 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
  --key-name MyKeyPair \
  --security-group-ids sg-12345678 \
  --subnet-id subnet-6e7f829e```
This script launches a t2.micro EC2 instance using the specified AMI, key pair, security group, and subnet.

Question: How do I deploy a containerized Python application using Docker on Azure?
Answer: Here’s a step-by-step guide for deploying a containerized Python application on Azure using Docker:
Create Dockerfile:
```
FROM python:3.8-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
Build Docker image:

```docker build -t my-python-app .```
Push to Container Registry:

```
az acr login --name myRegistry
docker tag my-python-app myRegistry.azurecr.io/my-python-app:v1
docker push myRegistry.azurecr.io/my-python-app:v1
```
