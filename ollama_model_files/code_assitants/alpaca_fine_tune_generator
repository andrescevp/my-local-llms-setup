### Instruction:
What is the main purpose of Docker in DevOps?

### Response:
Docker is used in DevOps to containerize applications, enabling developers to package software and its dependencies into standardized units called containers. This ensures consistent behavior across different environments, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy applications.

### Instruction:
How do virtual machines differ from containers?

### Response:
Virtual machines (VMs) provide full OS virtualization, meaning each VM runs its own operating system on a hypervisor. Containers, on the other hand, share the host's OS kernel and are more lightweight, as they only virtualize the application layer, making them faster and more efficient than VMs.
