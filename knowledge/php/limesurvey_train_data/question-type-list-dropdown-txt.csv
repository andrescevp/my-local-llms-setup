"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain how to set up a category separator in a dropdown question?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To set up a category separator in a dropdown question in LimeSurvey, follow these steps: \n1. **Create Dropdown Options**: Go to the question settings and select the dropdown question type.\n2. **Define Options**: In the list of options for the dropdown, you can specify the categories. Use the \""Category separator\"" attribute to insert a separator in your dropdown list. For example:\n\n```\nCategory A\n==\nOption 1\nOption 2\nCategory B\n==\nOption 3\nOption 4\n```\n3. **Save Settings**: Once you have configured your options, save the question. The separator \""==\"" will not be a selectable option but will visually separate the categories in the dropdown list, helping respondents navigate their choices more intuitively. \nThe example above would display as:\n- Category A\n  - Option 1\n  - Option 2\n- Category B\n  - Option 3\n  - Option 4.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
