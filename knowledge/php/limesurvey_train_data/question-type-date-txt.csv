Here\u2019s how to utilize it effectively:\n1. **Basic Validation**: Start by using the built-in date_min and date_max fields to enforce basic validity.\n2. **Custom Logic**: For more complex scenarios, leverage the `strtotime()` function. This function converts a given date into the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.\n   For instance, to compute the number of days since a departure date:\n   ```php\n   {(strtotime(\""now\"") - strtotime(departure))/60/60/24}\n   ```\n   This expression calculates the difference in days between the departure date and the current date.\n3. **Date Formats**: Ensure your survey is set to acceptable date formats like YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY, as not all formats work with `strtotime()`.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
