When this option is enabled during the question copying process, all subquestions will be carried over to the new question instance, maintaining the context and structure of the parent question. This is particularly useful for question types that support subquestions, such as matrix or array questions, allowing administrators to quickly replicate complex question formats without needing to recreate each subquestion manually.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
