"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does theme inheritance work in LimeSurvey 3?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Theme inheritance in LimeSurvey 3 allows users to extend existing core themes without altering the original template directly.

Here\u2019s how to properly extend a theme:\n1. Access the theme editor and select the core theme you wish to extend.\n2. Click the 'Extend' button, providing a new name for the theme copy (e.g., 'extends_fruity').\n3. Modify the HTML, CSS, and Twig components as needed.\n4.
