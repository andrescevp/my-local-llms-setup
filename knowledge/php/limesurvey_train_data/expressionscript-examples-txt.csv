"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does the Relevance feature work in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Relevance feature in LimeSurvey allows for dynamic control of question visibility. If the result of a relevance expression evaluates to \""true\"" (or 1), the related question group or question will be shown to participants. Conversely, if the expression evaluates to \""false\"" (or 0), that element will be hidden from the participant. This feature is crucial for tailoring surveys to individual respondents based on their previous answers, enhancing the user experience.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

For instance, if we want to hide a question about pet ownership (Question Group 2) unless the respondent answers \""yes\"" to the question \""Do you have a pet?\"" (Question Group 1), we can use a Relevance equation like:\n\n```plaintext\nPET == \""Y\""\n```\nHere, `PET` is the question code, and if the respondent selects \""Yes\"" (represented by Y), this expression becomes true, making Question Group 2 visible.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What role does Validation play in Expressions?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Validation in Expressions ensures that the input provided by the respondent meets specific criteria. If an input is considered valid, a \""good\"" class is applied and the corresponding message is shown; if invalid, an \""error\"" class is applied, and the user is provided feedback. For example, for a question validation equation that checks if a number is within a specified range, we might use:\n\n```plaintext\n(value >= 1 && value <= 10)\n```\nThis checks if the provided answer lies between 1 and 10.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can you use Expressions to dynamically output text?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Expressions can be used to generate dynamic text output based on previous answers or calculations. For example, if we want to output a personalized greeting that reflects the provided name:\n\n```plaintext\n\""Hello, \"" . {name} . \""!\""\n```\nIn this case, `{name}` refers to the answer input for the name question.

In the hidden question Q2, the expression could be:\n\n```plaintext\n{if(Q1.NAOK < 20, \""1\"", if(Q1.NAOK > 20, \""3\"", \""2\""))}\n```\nThis expression evaluates the age and assigns a group value (1, 2, or 3) accordingly while not displaying the question to the participant.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
