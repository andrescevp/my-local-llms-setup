It utilizes ExpressionScript to evaluate conditions based on previous answers. For example, if a survey asks how many children the respondent has, a relevance equation can ensure follow-up questions only appear for those with a specific number of children, such as using 'numKids == 3' to trigger questions related to the third child.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Here\u2019s an example of how to use a relevance equation in LimeSurvey.\nSuppose you want to ask follow-up questions based on the number of children a respondent has.

Based on the response:\n- To show questions related to parents with only one child, set the relevance equation for that question group to:\n```Expression\nnumKids == 1\n```\n- To show a separate group for respondents with two or more children, the relevance equation would be:\n```Expression\nnumKids > 1\n```\nThese equations ensure that only relevant questions are displayed to the respondents based on their answer to the initial question.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
