"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the character limits for short text responses on different database systems when using LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In LimeSurvey, the character limits for short text responses vary depending on the database system used. For users with MySQL databases, there is essentially no limit to the number of characters that can be entered. However, when using PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases, the maximum number of characters that can be entered is limited to 255. This distinction is crucial for developers to consider when designing surveys, particularly in the context of qualitative data collection.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
