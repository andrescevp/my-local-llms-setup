"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the short description of the Array by Column question type in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Array by Column question type in LimeSurvey is similar to an array question type, but the arrangement of the subquestion and answer axes is swapped. This format allows respondents to evaluate multiple subquestions against single-axis answers presented in columns, as opposed to rows. This structure can enhance the clarity and organization of responses for certain types of surveys.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

The specific example is also available for download as `Array by column example.zip`, which can help survey designers understand how to implement this question type effectively in their surveys.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Are there any specific notes regarding the Array by Column question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Yes, a key note regarding the Array by Column question type in LimeSurvey is that no relevance equation can be applied to the subquestion fields located on the X-scale. This limitation means that the logic for showing or hiding these subquestions cannot be dynamically adjusted based on the responses to other questions, which is an important consideration for survey design.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What general options are available for the Array by Column question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The general options available for the Array by Column question type include:\n- **Mandatory**: This option can be set to make answering the question required for survey completion.\n- **Relevance**: This option allows the question to be shown or hidden based on the responses to previous questions.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What display configurations can be adjusted for the Array by Column question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Several display configurations can be adjusted for the Array by Column question type, which include:\n- **Answer Width**: This setting customizes the width allocated for the answer choices in the question's layout.\n- **Hide Tip**: This option allows for the removal of tips or helper text usually presented alongside the question.\n- **Random Order**: This option randomizes the order of the answer choices to minimize bias.\n- **Question Theme**: Implements theming options for the question's visual representation.\n- **Hidden**: This allows questions to be hidden in certain cases, often controlled by relevance settings.\n- **CSS Class**: Custom CSS classes can be applied to enhance styling.\n- **Printable Survey Relevance Help**: This displays relevance help within print-friendly survey formats.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Identify the important omission regarding relevance equations for the Array by Column question type.""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""An important omission regarding the Array by Column question type is that no relevance equations can be utilized for the subquestion fields on the X-scale. This restriction means that designers must ensure that any dependencies between questions are carefully planned and that relevant information must be displayed without relying on dynamic changes based on previous answers, which could limit the adaptability of this question type in certain survey contexts.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does the Array by Column question type improve the clarity of survey responses?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Array by Column question type improves the clarity of survey responses by changing the arrangement of questions: instead of listing subquestions in rows with answers in columns, it presents subquestions as column headings. This vertical alignment can make it easier for respondents to see at a glance how their answers relate to various subquestions, thereby potentially increasing response accuracy and ensuring a more intuitive answering process.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you provide an example of how one might configure an Array by Column question in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Certainly! To configure an Array by Column question in LimeSurvey, you would first select 'Array by Column' as the question type. Here\u2019s a basic example:\n\n```plaintext\nQuestion: How satisfied are you with the following aspects of our service?\n\nSubquestions (Column Headings):\n- Quality\n- Speed\n- Customer Support\n\nAnswers (Y-axis Options):\n- Very Satisfied\n- Satisfied\n- Neutral\n- Dissatisfied\n- Very Dissatisfied\n```\n\nIn this setup, respondents would evaluate their satisfaction with the Quality, Speed, and Customer Support by selecting an option on the Y-axis. It is important to review general and display options, like making the question mandatory or whether to hide tips, to suit your survey's needs.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
