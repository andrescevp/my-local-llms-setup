When using this feature, it is important to ensure that the 'Finalize response submission' option is checked in order to save responses as completed entries; otherwise, responses may remain marked as incomplete.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What happens if the 'Finalize response submission' checkbox is not checked?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""If the 'Finalize response submission' checkbox is not checked, the response will be considered 'not completely filled out.' This means that no submission date will be recorded, and the token code (if applicable) will remain available for the participant, allowing them to complete the survey later. This is particularly useful when the survey is designed to be filled out in stages or if some answers are prefilled and require additional input.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
