"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of the file upload question type in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The file upload question type in LimeSurvey is designed to collect files from respondents as part of their survey responses. It allows users to submit various files, which can be essential for surveys that require documentation, such as resumes or scanned identification documents in an employment-related survey. This feature not only enhances the data collection process but also ensures that the survey designers can have the necessary documents directly linked to the responses provided by the participants.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does the file upload feature ensure file restrictions?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The file upload feature includes options that allow the survey administrator to set specific restrictions on the files that can be uploaded. For instance, these restrictions can include limiting uploads to certain file types (such as PNG, JPG, or JPEG) and imposing size limits (e.g., files must be less than 1 MB). This ensures that the data collected is manageable and meets the criteria set by the survey designer, thereby enhancing the overall quality and relevance of the uploaded data.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
