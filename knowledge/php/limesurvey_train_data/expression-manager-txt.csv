Instead of using a basic 'Goto Logic', EM allows you to specify complex criteria under which a question is made visible or hidden based on prior answers. \n\nFor instance, if a survey question requires the calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI), EM can set a relevance condition such as `{!is_empty(height) and !is_empty(weight)}` which dynamically shows the BMI question only if both height and weight inputs are provided, thus preventing errors like division by zero.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can you create a conditional equation for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI)?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) conditionally using Expression Manager, you can create equations based on user inputs regarding weight and height. Here's how you might implement this:\n\n1. **Input Variables**: Assume we have two input fields: `weight` and `height`.\n2. **Conditional Expressions**: You can define the variables related to whether the weight is entered in kilograms or pounds and convert accordingly. The expressions might look something like this:\n```php\nweight_kg = {if(weight_units == 'kg', weight, weight * 0.453592)};\nheight_m = {if(height_units == 'cm', height / 100, height * 0.0254)};\nBMI = weight_kg / (height_m * height_m);\n```\nIn this case, `weight_units` and `height_units` determine the conversion based on the input type. The BMI will only be calculated if both height and weight are provided.\n\n3. **Implementation in Survey Logic**: In your survey, you need to set up the following relevance condition to show the BMI field:\n```php\nBMI_relevance = {!is_empty(weight) and !is_empty(height)};\n```\nThis ensures that the BMI is only calculated and presented when both fields contain valid input to prevent computational errors.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
