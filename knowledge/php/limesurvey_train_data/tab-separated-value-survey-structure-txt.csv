"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can users effectively start using the TSV import/export feature?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To effectively start using the TSV import/export feature in LimeSurvey, users can take the following steps: 1. **Export an Existing Survey**: Begin by accessing an existing survey within LimeSurvey and use the normal export survey button. Opt for the 'Tab Separated Values format (*.txt)' instead of the default .lss format. This will provide a correctly formatted Tab Separated Value file. 2. **Open with Spreadsheet Software**: Open the .txt file using any spreadsheet software that supports tab-separated values (like OpenOffice or LibreOffice). Remember that LimeSurvey ignores formatting but supports tab-separated values for editing. 3. **Handle UTF-8 Encoding**: Note that the exported file is in UTF-8 format with a Byte Order Mark (BOM). To ensure proper opening in Excel, you should first open Excel, then navigate to File:Open, and explicitly select the .txt file, confirming the UTF-8 encoding.

Ensure you have the 'default' column included. 2. **Enter Default Values**: For each question that requires a default value, enter the desired default value in the 'default' column next to the corresponding question row. For instance, if you have a multiple-choice question asking for a favorite color, you might want a default value set to 'Blue'. Here\u2019s a snippet of how a TSV entry might look:\n   ```\n   #id    #class    #type    #name     #text                 #default\n   1      Q         M       fav_color What is your favorite color?

Doing so will effectively set all questions to non-mandatory during tests. 3. **Import the Test Spreadsheet**: Import the non-mandatory version of the spreadsheet into LimeSurvey to create a testing survey. This will allow users to assess the survey flow and logic without the restrictions imposed by mandatory questions. 4. **Conduct Testing**: Go through the survey as a participant would, evaluating the functionality and flow of questions. Ensure that the survey operates as expected and collects data efficiently without the mandatory constraints. 5. **Reimport the Master Copy**: After testing is completed, reimport the master copy with all questions set to mandatory for the final survey deployment.

After all groups, questions, subquestions, and answers for the primary language are added, duplicate these rows for each subsequent language. 2. **Update Language Column**: For each set of duplicated rows, change the 'language' field to reflect the language you are translating into (e.g., 'en' for English, 'fr' for French, etc.). Make sure that all entries maintain the same numeric identifiers across languages. 3. **Consistency in Entry Counts**: Ensure that the number and order of rows remain consistent between the primary language and secondary languages. Every entry must have an equivalent counterpart in the translated sections to maintain relationships when imported. 4. **Translation Workflow**: Create copies of your spreadsheet for each language, allowing translators to work independently on the content while keeping track of the structure. 5. **Import and Test**: Import the completed TSV file into LimeSurvey.

Here\u2019s a detailed explanation of the requirements: 1. **File Encoding**: The TSV file must be encoded in UTF-8 format, with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) prefixed to the contents, ensuring compatibility with LimeSurvey's import mechanisms. 2. **Column Headings**: The file must include specific column headings, usually the first 14 columns serve various purposes based on the entity type being defined (groups, questions, answers). For instance, the first column typically represents the ID (identifier) for the item, with subsequent columns detailing aspects like class, type, name, relevance, and text, among others. 3. **Row Structure**: Each entity (group, question, subquestion, answer, etc.) must occupy a single row, which clearly states its attributes through the established column headings. 4. **Data Types and Values**: Entries within the columns must conform to expected inputs, e.g., the 'mandatory' column often uses 'Y' or 'N' for yes or no, while 'language' should include valid language codes (e.g., 'en' for English). 5. **Consistent Order**: If multiple languages are included, the order of rows and identifiers must remain consistent for each language version; this allows LimeSurvey to maintain the relationships correctly upon import.
