"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the significance of version numbering in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Version numbering in LimeSurvey helps users understand the development and support lifecycle of the software. It provides a context for upgrades and compatibility. For example, LimeSurvey version 2.06 marked the transition to a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, meaning it would receive updates until the next LTS version was released. The versioning indicates major milestones in the software's evolution, such as the introduction of new features or significant changes in architecture. Understanding this structure helps users assess whether they should upgrade and the implications of doing so.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the major LimeSurvey versions and their differences?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The major versions of LimeSurvey include 2.06, 2.73, and 3.x. Each version introduced significant changes, especially in terms of template engines:\n1. **LimeSurvey 2.06**: Established the LTS pathway and set a basis for subsequent releases. Templates created for this version are incompatible with later versions.\n2. **LimeSurvey 2.73**: Introduced responsive default templates, necessitating changes in the HTML structure, incompatible with templates from version 2.06.\n3. **LimeSurvey 3.x**: This version adopted the Twig template system and a template inheritance approach, marking a stark departure from older HTML-based templates and making them incompatible with templates from the 2.x series.\nThe incompatibility means that users must create new templates tailored for each major version to ensure correct rendering and functionality.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Why were the template engines changed in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The template engines in LimeSurvey were changed to improve functionality and user experience. LimeSurvey 2.50 introduced responsive templates, which required a significant overhaul of the HTML structure to ensure templates would look good on mobile devices. This necessitated a departure from the previous template system used in 2.06 and earlier versions. In LimeSurvey 3, the introduction of the Twig template system and a new inheritance model further enhanced flexibility and modularity in template design. However, these changes also led to incompatibility with earlier templates, which means users need to create new templates to take advantage of the new features.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What does LTS mean for LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""LTS stands for Long-Term Support. In the context of LimeSurvey, an LTS version is one that is guaranteed to receive bug fixes and security updates for an extended period. This ensures that users can rely on that version for stability and security without needing to upgrade frequently. For example, LimeSurvey 3 is currently marked as LTS and will not have new features added to it, allowing users to maintain a stable environment while still receiving important updates. The decision to label a version as LTS helps users in planning their upgrade strategies.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
