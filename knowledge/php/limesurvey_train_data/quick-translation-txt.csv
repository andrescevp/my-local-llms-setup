"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the difference between the quick translation and auto-translate features in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The quick translation feature in LimeSurvey allows users to manually translate survey content type by type, providing a tailored translation experience based on human input. In contrast, the auto-translate feature utilizes the Google Translate web service to automatically translate survey content, which may offer faster results but can be less accurate. \n\nFor manual translation, users need to have specific permissions assigned, whereas auto-translation requires a Google Translate API key to be configured in LimeSurvey CE or is available directly for LimeSurvey Cloud users without the need for a key. This allows for flexibility depending on the users' requirements and the complexity of the translation tasks.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What troubleshooting steps should one take if not all translations are saved when using the quick translation feature?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""If not all translations are saved during the quick translation process in LimeSurvey, this might be due to exceeding the maximum number of post variables allowed by PHP. By default, PHP allows for a maximum of 1000 post variables. To address this issue:\n1. **Check PHP Configuration**: In your PHP setup, look for the 'max_input_vars' directive.\n2. **Increase Limit**: Modify the 'max_input_vars' setting to a higher value, such as 5000 or better yet, 10000.\n3. **Contact Admin**: If you are unsure how to make these changes, reach out to your server administrator for assistance.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What challenges might arise from using large surveys in terms of translation saving?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""When using large surveys, one of the main challenges that can arise is that the number of translation variables sent to the server may exceed the PHP limit for post variables, which is typically set to 1000 by default. Therefore, for larger surveys, many translation fields may remain unsaved or ignored due to this limitation. To overcome this, users need to adjust their PHP settings by increasing the 'max_input_vars' directive to a higher value (like 5000 or 10000) to ensure all variables are processed correctly during the translation saving process.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
