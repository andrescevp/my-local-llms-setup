For instance, if the response indicates one child, the equation could be 'numKids == 1', leading to different follow-up questions specific to single-child scenarios. Conversely, 'numKids > 1' could show questions relevant to those with multiple children, enhancing the survey's relevance.  \n2. **Customer Satisfaction Survey:** In a customer satisfaction survey, if the initial question asks whether a customer has used a particular product, a relevance equation can control whether subsequent questions about the product features or quality appear based on their affirmative response.  \nThese examples show how relevance equations customize the survey experience, making it dependent on previous answers and allowing for better data collection based on specific respondent attributes.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
