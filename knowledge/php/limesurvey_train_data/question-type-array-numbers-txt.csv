"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of the Array (Numbers) question type in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Array (Numbers) question type in LimeSurvey is designed to enable survey administrators to create large arrays comprising numbered dropdown boxes. This structure allows for a set of sub-questions to be displayed on the 'y-axis' and another set of sub-questions on the 'x-axis'. This format is particularly useful for handling comparisons or evaluations in surveys, making it easier for respondents to provide input across multiple dimensions collectively.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain the functionality of the special question attribute for the Array (Numbers) question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The special question attribute for the Array (Numbers) question type allows survey administrators to configure the question such that it uses checkboxes instead of dropdown boxes. This can enhance user interaction for specific types of surveys where multiple selections per row are preferable, making it easier for respondents to choose options that apply instead of being restricted to a single choice. In this setup, the resulting data can reflect multiple responses across various sub-questions more effectively.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are some examples of how the Array (Numbers) question type can be used in surveys?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Array (Numbers) question type can be utilized in various ways in surveys. For example:\n\n1. **Customer Satisfaction Surveys**: Evaluating customer satisfaction across various service attributes, such as cleanliness, speed of service, and overall satisfaction level. Each attribute can be a sub-question, showing ratings across all evaluated aspects.\n\n2. **Product Feedback**: Collecting feedback on different features of a product. Respondents can rate multiple features (sub-questions) using numbers, providing quantitative insights into product performance.\n\n3. **Employee Surveys**: Assessing multiple competencies or performances within a department, where employees can be rated on various skills or job functions through an array setup.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What limitations should be considered when using the Array (Numbers) question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""One notable limitation when using the Array (Numbers) question type is that no relevance equations can be employed in the sub-question fields located on the X-scale. This means that certain logic parameters cannot dynamically change based on previous answers, which may restrict the complexity of some surveys. Administrators must take this into account while designing surveys, especially if they require adaptive questioning techniques based on respondent selections.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What general options can be set for the Array (Numbers) question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""For the Array (Numbers) question type, several general options can be configured to tailor the survey experience, including: \n1. **Mandatory**: Designate the question as required, ensuring respondents cannot skip it.\n2. **Relevance**: Establish conditions under which the question is displayed, depending on responses to previous questions.\n3. **Validation Rules**: Implement validation rules for responses, such as ensuring responses are numeric or meet specific criteria. These options enhance the effectiveness of the question type by ensuring clarity, relevance, and proper data collection.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can the display characteristics be modified for the Array (Numbers) question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The display characteristics of the Array (Numbers) question type can be adjusted using various configuration options. Some key display options include: \n1. **Sub-question Width**: Modify the width of the sub-question columns to enhance visibility and accessibility in the survey layout.\n2. **Hide Tip**: Choose to hide tips or help text for the question, simplifying the interface if required.\n3. **Random Order**: Shuffle the sub-questions presentation order to minimize bias in responses, contributing to a balanced data collection method.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
