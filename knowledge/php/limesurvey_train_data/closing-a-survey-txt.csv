"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What happens to the results and participant information when a survey is deactivated?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""When a survey is deactivated in LimeSurvey, several critical changes occur regarding the results and participant information:\n\n1. **Loss of Results**:\n   - All collected results of the survey are lost permanently. This means any responses submitted by participants before deactivation cannot be retrieved or accessed through the LimeSurvey user interface.\n\n2. **Loss of Participant Information**:\n   - Similar to results, any data related to the participants, such as their responses, identification, and engagement with the survey, is also lost. Once a survey is deactivated, there is no way to trace who participated or any personal information associated with them.\n\n3. **Inaccessibility**:\n   - Deactivated surveys become completely inaccessibile to participants. If any participant attempts to access the survey post-deactivation, they will encounter a message stating that they are not permitted to view the survey.\n\n4. **Editability of Questions**:\n   - After deactivation, all questions, groups, and parameters of the survey can be edited again. This provides relief if changes or revisions to the survey structure are required after the survey has been stopped.\n\nIn summary, deactivation results in total loss of both results and participant data, and a blanket inaccessibility of the survey.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Why is it recommended to use the expiry option over the deactivation option?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Using the expiry option to manage surveys in LimeSurvey instead of deactivation is recommended for several reasons:\n\n1. **Data Preservation**:\n   - When a survey is expired, all results and respondent information remain intact and accessible. This preserves valuable data that has been collected during the survey period.\n\n2. **Limited Changes Allowed**:\n   - Expiring a survey allows for limited modifications to questions and settings without jeopardizing existing responses. This means that if adjustments are needed to the survey after it has been collected, they can still be managed to some extent.\n\n3. **Continued Access to Responses for Analysis**:\n   - Expired surveys still allow users to perform statistical analyses on the responses, providing business intelligence and insights even after the survey is closed.\n\n4. **Controlled Closure**:\n   - Expiring a survey communicates to participants that the survey remains closed for new responses while still maintaining the integrity of existing data. Participants are informed that their submissions are safe and accounted for.\n\n5. **Reactivation Options**:\n   - If adjustments need to be made or if you wish to reopen the survey for a further period, simply changing or removing the expiration date allows for seamless reactivation for participants, which is not possible with deactivated surveys.\n\nOverall, opting for expiration rather than deactivation provides greater control over the survey lifecycle and data management.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does LimeSurvey handle the import of responses from a deactivated survey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""LimeSurvey manages the import of responses from a deactivated survey using a structured process that ensures compatibility and accuracy during the data transfer:\n\n1. **Reactivation Requirement**:\n   - Before importing, you must first reactivate the closed survey. This step is essential as it allows LimeSurvey to prepare the target survey for assimilating old data.\n\n2. **Accessing Import Responses Option**:\n   - In the responses section of the survey interface, you\u2019ll find the 'Import' option. By selecting this, you can initiate the import process from the deactivated survey.\n\n3. **Selecting the Source Table**:\n   - You will need to identify and select the source table from which responses will be imported. The compatibility of the source table with the current questionnaire structure is pivotal for a successful transfer.\n\n4. **Data Compatibility Checks**:\n   - LimeSurvey implements compatibility checks comparing the column types and names between the source table and the current survey. Notably, the ID field is ignored in this assessment, ensuring that any changes to identifiers do not affect the import.\n\n5. **Handling of Changes**:\n   - The system is designed to handle specific changes in the question mapping. For example:\n     - If a question has been moved to another group, the result is imported correctly.\n     - If a question has been removed from the active survey, that result is ignored during import.\n     - If a new question has been added, that result is set to the database's default value.\n\n6. **User Warnings**:\n   - It\u2019s important to note that using type coercion may introduce errors in data; it\u2019s advised to use this function sparingly or not at all.\n\nBy following these steps, LimeSurvey allows users to effectively recover valuable data from deactivated surveys while adhering to set compatibility rules.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What limitations does LimeSurvey impose on changing questions after a survey is expired?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Once a survey in LimeSurvey has been expired, it comes with specific limitations regarding changes to its structure, particularly concerning questions. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Limited Modifications**:\n   - After expiring a survey, changes to questions, groups, and parameters are restricted. This means that survey designers cannot freely alter any existing questions, which helps in maintaining the responses collected prior to expiration.\n\n2. **Integrity of Data**:\n   - The restriction on changes is fundamentally aimed at preserving data integrity. Since responses are still accessible for analysis and reporting after expiration, it's crucial that the original questions match those that were presented to respondents during their interactions with the survey.\n\n3. **No New Questions**:\n   - Users are not permitted to add new questions to an expired survey. This restriction helps to avoid confusion and ensures that the analysis reflects the same set of questions as originally answered by participants.\n\n4. **Necessary Adjustments**:\n   - If adjustments are needed for future use, it\u2019s recommended to create a new version of the survey rather than modifying the expired survey. This enables users to implement new questions or adjust the format without jeopardizing the provided responses.\n\nIn summary, once a survey is expired, limitations ensure that the data collected remains valid and that results are meaningful for analysis, maintaining fidelity to the original responses.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What should you do before deactivating a survey to avoid data loss?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To prevent data loss when deactivating a survey in LimeSurvey, it is crucial to follow these recommendations:\n\n1. **Export Responses**:\n   - Before proceeding with deactivation, make sure to export all collected responses. Use the export feature within LimeSurvey to create a backup of the responses, allowing you to retain this data outside of the LimeSurvey system.\n   - You can generally find the export option in the responses section of your survey, where various formats for exporting data (such as CSV or Excel) may be available.\n\n2. **Ensure Accuracy**:\n   - Double-check that your export was successful and that the data is complete and correct. This ensures that no information is lost during the transition.\n\n3. **Take Notes on Current Survey Configuration**:\n   - Document the current survey settings, questions, and any important parameters you may want to reference later. This documentation will help recreate or analyze the survey structure if needed after the deactivation.\n\n4. **Communicate with Stakeholders**:\n   - If the survey results are crucial for decision-making, ensure that stakeholders are aware of your intention to deactivate the survey. This communication helps them to prepare for any potential impacts that may follow.\n\nBy taking these precautions before deactivating a survey, you can effectively protect against unexpected data loss.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
