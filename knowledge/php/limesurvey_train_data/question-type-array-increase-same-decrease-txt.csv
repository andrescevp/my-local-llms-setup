It is prefilled with answer options such as 'Increase', 'Same', and 'Decrease'. Additionally, a 'No answer' option is included automatically for questions that are not mandatory. This allows respondents to provide nuanced feedback across multiple items efficiently. \n\nThis question type is particularly useful when assessing variations across a set of related items or statements, enabling easy data collection and analysis. The array format is versatile and can enhance the respondent's experience by reducing the effort required to answer related questions in one glance.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

When a question is set as mandatory, respondents are required to answer it before moving on to the next question in the survey. \n\nHere\u2019s how to configure it:\n1. In the question settings, find the 'Mandatory' option (often labeled as {{QS:mandatory}}).\n2. Set the value to 'Yes' or check the appropriate checkbox to enforce that respondents cannot skip this question.\n\nFor example, in YAML configuration:\n```yaml\nmandatory: true\n``` \nThis ensures that respondents must provide at least one response from the array options before proceeding.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Here's an example of how to set up an array type question in LimeSurvey.\n\nYou might want to assess employee satisfaction in a company, where respondents can evaluate different aspects on a scale of 'Increase', 'Same', 'Decrease', with a 'No answer' option if it's not mandatory. The question setup could be as follows:\n\n1. **Question text**: 'How do you feel about the following aspects of your job?'  \n2. **Array question type**:  \n   - Row labels:  \n     - Work Environment  \n     - Work-Life Balance  \n     - Communication with Management  \n   - Column labels:  \n     - Increase  \n     - Same  \n     - Decrease  \n     - No answer  \n \nIn the LimeSurvey interface, setting the question type to 'Array' allows respondents to fill in their assessments:\n```plaintext\n                    | Increase | Same | Decrease | No answer |\n-----------------------------------------\nWork Environment |     []    |  []  |    []    |    []     |\nWork-Life Balance|     []    |  []  |    []    |    []     |\nCommunication with Management| [] |  []  |    []    |    []     |\n```\nBy collecting responses through this structured format, data analysts can easily generate meaningful insights regarding employee satisfaction.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Aim for a maximum of 5-7 items at a time.\n\n3. **Mandatory Options**: Use mandatory options judiciously; only require answers when absolutely necessary to avoid frustration.\n\n4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use formatting options to create visual distinctions between different sections, making the survey more navigable.\n\n5. **Testing**: Pre-test the survey with a sample audience to gather feedback on question clarity and usability. Make adjustments based on the findings.\n\n6. **Conditional Logic**: Use branching logic sparingly to ensure that respondents only see relevant follow-up questions based on their responses in the array. This keeps them engaged and reduces the complexity of the survey flow.\n\nBy adhering to these best practices, survey designers can create effective and user-friendly array questions that yield valuable insights.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
