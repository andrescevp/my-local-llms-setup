"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What considerations should be made when enabling the mandatory attribute for ranking questions?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""When enabling the mandatory attribute in a ranking question type, it is important to consider that respondents must assess all answer options provided. This ensures comprehensive feedback but may also lead to frustration if participants are overwhelmed with options. To alleviate potential issues, you can implement minimum and/or maximum answer settings to control the number of options they must rank, allowing for flexibility in how they engage with the question.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can minimum and maximum answer options be set for a ranking question?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To set minimum and maximum answer options in a ranking question, you need to use the features provided within the LimeSurvey platform. Specifically, you would:\n1. **Minimum Answers (min_answers)**: This attribute allows you to specify the minimum number of options a respondent is required to rank. This helps ensure that crucial options are given consideration.\n2. **Maximum Answers (max_answers)**: This attribute sets the maximum number of options that can be ranked by a respondent, preventing them from ranking too many choices, which can dilute response quality.\n\nExample of setting these in LimeSurvey settings might look like this:\n```php\n'attributes' => [\n    'min_answers' => 2,\n    'max_answers' => 5,\n],\n```\nThis will require respondents to rank at least 2 and no more than 5 alternatives.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
