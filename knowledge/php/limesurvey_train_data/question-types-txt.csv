"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What steps must be taken before adding questions to a LimeSurvey survey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Prior to adding questions to a LimeSurvey survey, it is essential to create a question group. A LimeSurvey survey is structured into question groups that contain one or more questions. The process typically involves:\n1. **Creating a Question Group**: Users must create a question group first, which can be done through the survey administration interface.\n2. **Adding Questions**: Once the question group is established, users can then proceed to add individual questions to the group. This hierarchical structure allows for a more organized layout of the survey and helps in better managing the flow of questions presented to respondents.\nFor further details on how to manage question groups, refer to the wiki section on question groups.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are subquestions in the context of LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In LimeSurvey, subquestions refer to individual questions that are part of a larger question type, particularly with array-type questions. While a standard question typically has a single set of answers, array-type questions consist of multiple subquestions, each allowing respondents to provide answers based on a predefined scale of response options. For instance, in an 'Array of texts' question type, respondents must fill in responses for various subquestions, presenting a more complex structure of data collection.\nThe array structure entails that each subquestion is displayed in a manner that respondents can evaluate against standardized answer choices (e.g., a Likert scale). This facilitates richer data collection and allows users to gather nuanced insights across multiple aspects of a single theme in one go.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the significance of the Array question type in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Array question type in LimeSurvey significantly enhances the functionality of surveys by allowing users to present a matrix-style layout.
