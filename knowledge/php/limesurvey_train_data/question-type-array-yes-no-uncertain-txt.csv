"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the Array (Yes-No-Uncertain) question type in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Array (Yes-No-Uncertain) question type in LimeSurvey is designed to present respondents with a structured set of options for each question item, specifically prefilled with responses: \""Yes\"", \""No\"", and \""Uncertain\"". An additional option labeled \""No answer\"" can be included to allow respondents to skip the question if it is not mandatory. This question type is particularly useful for gathering clear and structured data regarding respondents' positions or feelings about various statements or topics. The prefilled options streamline the survey process by providing standard response choices that can help ensure consistency across responses.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
