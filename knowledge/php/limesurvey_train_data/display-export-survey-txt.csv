"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the two main reasons for exporting a LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The two main reasons for exporting a LimeSurvey are: 1. **Backup**: When a survey becomes complex or is finalized after significant work, exporting it acts as a backup to ensure that all configurations, questions, and answers are preserved. This is crucial to avoid data loss. 2. **Data Manipulation**: Users may need to export surveys to edit them in spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice, allowing for bulk editing or modifications that are more manageable outside the LimeSurvey environment.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What types of files can you export from LimeSurvey and what do they contain?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""LimeSurvey allows for the export of several file types, each serving different purposes:\n1. **Survey Structure (.lss)**: This XML file includes the entire structure of the survey, encompassing groups, questions, subquestions, answers, and conditions, but does not include collected responses.\n2. **Survey Archive (.lsa)**: A complete backup which contains the survey structure, response data, participant data (if activated), and timing data; this file is intended for archival purposes.\n3. **queXML Format (*.xml)**: This option exports data in queXML format, useful for offline surveys. However, it does not include all question types or export conditions.\n4. **queXML PDF Export**: Similar to the queXML format, but allows editing options before exporting.\n5. **Tab-separated Values Format (*.txt)**: Ideal for bulk editing surveys, this format can be manipulated easily in spreadsheet software.\n6. **Printable Survey (*.html)**: A format that prepares the survey for printing and contains all required stylesheets; it lacks logic functionality.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of exporting the survey archive (.lsa)?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The purpose of exporting the survey archive (.lsa) is to create a complete backup of an active survey for archival and future review. This export includes not only the survey structure but also all response data and participant information if participant settings are enabled. It allows users to re-import past survey data back into LimeSurvey, facilitating analysis and reporting of prior survey results.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What does the queXML format export include and what are its limitations?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The queXML format exports include a structured XML description of the questionnaire, allowing for the creation of printed PDFs that can be filled in offline and later scanned for processing. However, its limitations include the inability to export conditions and certain question types. Notably, it is designed for offline use and is not suitable for creating a complete backup of surveys due to its selective feature set.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain how to export a survey structure and what it contains?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To export a survey structure in LimeSurvey, navigate to the survey settings and find the option labeled ''Display/Export'' in the top toolbar. From there, you will select ''Export survey structure (.lss)''. This export will create a .lss file, which is essentially an XML representation of the survey's composition. The file contains details on all groups, questions, subquestions, answers, and conditions. It is important to note that this export does not include any collected responses.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can exporting to tab-separated values format benefit survey authors?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Exporting a survey to tab-separated values format (.txt) significantly benefits authors by simplifying the editing process. This format allows for bulk operations such as find-replace, reordering questions, repeating groups, and disabling mandatory criteria, which can be efficiently managed using spreadsheet software like Excel. It eliminates reliance on complex SGQA codes, thereby making the editing process more user-friendly and less error-prone for large surveys.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What does exporting a printable survey in HTML format entail?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Exporting a printable survey in HTML format involves downloading a .zip file that contains the survey formatted for HTML and all necessary stylesheets for displaying on any HTML-ready device or browser. This option allows survey authors to create a visually consistent printed document. However, one must consider that this exported version lacks any logic or advanced functionality provided by LimeSurvey, which must be taken into account during design or edits.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What warnings should users be aware of before exporting surveys?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Before exporting surveys, users should heed several warnings:\n1. Certain export options do not include collected response data, such as the Export survey structure (.lss), meaning it is strictly for structure backup, not responses.\n2. The queXML format does not support all question types or the exportation of conditions, limiting its full utility for complex surveys.\n3. Users should confirm that they understand the implications of each format's limitations to ensure appropriate usage aligns with their goals and expectations.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you list the question types that can be exported using queXML format?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The queXML format currently supports exporting a variety of question types, including:\n- **Arrays**: Including 5 point choice, 10 point choice, Yes/Uncertain/No options, and flexible formats.\n- **Mask questions**: Such as Date, Gender dropdown, Numerical questions and Yes/No radio buttons.\n- **Multiple choice questions**: With multiple options using checkboxes.\n- **Single choice questions**: Including dropdown lists and 5 point choices.\n- **Text questions**: Covering multiple short text, short free text, long free text, and huge free text options.\n\nNote that some question types, like ranking styles and slider controls, are not yet implemented in this export format.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Conversely, the 'Printable survey' gives a streamlined print layout directly from LimeSurvey without generating a downloadable zip.\n2. **Styles**: The 'Printable survey' option automatically loads all necessary styles into the document, allowing for immediate printing using browser controls, while the HTML export requires users to retrieve and manage styles separately.\n3. **Functionality**: Both options do not include any logic or ExpressionScript functionalities, but the use case differs in the convenience of immediate printing via a browser in the 'Printable survey' option.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

This contains all questions and group data but note it does not include the custom template itself.\n3. **Import the Survey Structure**: On the new server, use the 'Import survey' feature to bring in the .lss file to reconstruct the survey.\n4. **Import the Custom Template**: Finally, import the previously exported custom template zip file to ensure it is available on the new server for the reconstructed survey.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
