"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain how the class structure works for questions in LimeSurvey themes?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In LimeSurvey themes, each question type is associated with specific CSS classes that facilitate consistent styling and functionality. Here's how the class structure typically functions:\n1. **Unique Classes for Each Question Type**: Each question type has a distinct class. For example, a multiple choice question might have `.answers-list`, while a single choice question could use `.answer-item`. This provides specific hooks for styling and scripting.\n2. **Validation Classes**: Additional classes such as `.mandatory` or `.input-error` provide context for validation status. For instance, a mandatory question not answered will have both classes applied, allowing CSS rules to indicate an error state visually. \n3. **Nested Structures**: Classes can be nested based on question complexity. For example, in an array question, sub-questions might utilize `.subquestions-list`, categorizing them under a general `.answers-list` for comprehensive styling.\n4. **Global Styles**: Furthermore, global styles can target many elements (like `.question`) that apply across numerous question types, streamlining adherence to design principles throughout the survey.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
