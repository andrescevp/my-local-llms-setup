"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is an array question type in LimeSurvey and how can it be used effectively?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""An array question type in LimeSurvey allows you to create a set of subquestions that use the same set of answer options, making it useful for gathering feedback on multiple aspects of a particular product or service efficiently. For example, if you are surveying users about a product, you can use an array to ask them to rate various features on a Likert scale, enabling respondents to evaluate all features in one concise question.\n\nWhen creating an array question, each subquestion is presented in rows while the answer options are presented in the columns. This setup not only saves space but also allows for easier comparison of responses across different subquestions. \n\nConsider the following example of rating four sci-fi movies:\n\n```plaintext\nWhich of the following sci-fi movies did you enjoy?\n\n| Movie Name         | Rate 1-5  |\n|--------------------|-----------|\n| Movie 1           | [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] |\n| Movie 2           | [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] |\n| Movie 3           | [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] |\n| Movie 4           | [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] |\n```\nThis format allows for easy data collection and analysis, as the responses can be aggregated systematically and visualized for statistical outputs.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the Semantic Differential question type in LimeSurvey and how can it be implemented?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Semantic Differential question type in LimeSurvey is a specialized format of the array question type that enables users to give responses on a scale that reflects bipolar adjectives. In simpler terms, it allows participants to rate an item by choosing a value along a continuum ranging from one extreme to another.\n\nTo implement this question type, a respondent might see a question structured where they need to rate the subject (e.g., a product or experience) based on opposing adjectives like 'Good' and 'Evil'. Here\u2019s how you would set up such a question:\n\n1. **Select the Array Type**: Choose either 'Array' or 'Array (5 point choice)' as the question type.\n2. **Define Labels**: In the answer field, input your adjectives separated by a pipe character '|'. For instance, to create a scale from 'Good' to 'Evil', you would simply write:\n   ```plaintext\n   Good|Evil\n   ```\n3. **Display the Question**: LimeSurvey will then render this selection as an array for the respondent to evaluate.\n\nThis approach adds nuance to the survey by allowing respondents to express opinions that are more varied than simple binary choices, improving the quality and depth of data collected.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Here are some key general options:\n\n1. **Mandatory**: This setting enforces that respondents must answer this question before proceeding, ensuring that data is gathered for each array question.\n\n2. **Relevance**: This option allows you to set conditions under which the question will be shown or hidden based on previous answers, enabling dynamic survey flows.\n\n3. **Subquestion Width**: Adjusts the width of subquestions in the display, allowing for better legibility depending on the content length.\n\n4. **Random Order**: This feature randomly shuffles the order of the subquestions each time the survey is loaded, which can help mitigate bias in the order of responses.\n\n5. **Repeat Headers**: When enabled, the header row for answer options can be repeated on subsequent pages, enhancing clarity for lengthy surveys.\n\nThese general options provide flexibility and control over how array questions are presented and function within a survey, allowing for a more tailored respondent experience.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does the display configuration work for array question types in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The display configuration of array question types in LimeSurvey allows survey designers to control the presentation aspects of their questions, enhancing usability and respondent engagement. Here's a breakdown of display configurations:\n\n1. **Subquestion Width**: This property allows custom adjustment of the width of the individual subquestions' display area. This is particularly useful for ensuring that longer question text does not get truncated, improving readability.\n\n2. **Random Order**: Enabling this feature ensures that the order of subquestions is randomized for each respondent. This reduces the risk of order bias, where respondents may favor items presented first or refuse to answer items presented later.\n\n3. **Repeat Headers**: Particularly useful for longer array questions, this option can display the header row (the row of answer options) at the top of every page if the array is split into multiple pages. This enhances clarity and aids respondent memory when evaluating multiple subquestions.\n\n4. **Question Theme**: Customize the visual theme of the question, allowing it to align with branding or specific survey layouts.\n\n5. **CSS Class**: If advanced styling is required, custom CSS classes can be assigned to the question for targeted styling.\n\nThese display settings enable creators to optimize the presentation of array questions to improve the respondent experience and data quality.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Here are the key logic options:\n\n1. **Min Answers**: This option sets a minimum number of responses that must be provided by the respondent for the question to be considered complete. This ensures that data collected is meaningful and can be used effectively in analysis.\n\n2. **Max Answers**: Conversely, this setting limits the maximum responses a participant can provide in an array question, ensuring clarity and focus in their evaluations.\n\n3. **Array Filter**: This feature enables filtering of array subquestions based on previous responses or conditions within the survey, allowing certain questions to be displayed only if specific criteria are met.\n\n4. **Array Filter Style**: Controls how filtering effects are presented visually to respondents, which helps guide them through the survey more intuitively.\n\n5. **Exclusive Option**: When enabled, this option ensures that only one answer can be selected per row within the array question, reinforcing binary question logic within the array setup.\n\nThese logic options enhance the interactivity of array questions by providing tools to ensure that responses are relevant and tailored to respondents, which ultimately leads to higher quality data collection.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

Here\u2019s how this can be done:\n\n1. **Public Statistics**: This option allows you to enable or disable the visibility of statistical data from the survey. If enabled, the summarized statistical information from the responses can be shared with respondents or made public as part of reporting. This transparency can boost trust in the survey process.\n\n2. **Display Chart**: Once public statistics are enabled, you can choose to enable the display of charts corresponding to the array questions. Charts compel visual representation of data, making it easier for users to digest results effectively.\n\n3. **Chart Type**: LimeSurvey supports various chart styles (like bar charts, pie charts, etc.) to visualize data. You can select the appropriate type of chart that best represents your data while also aligning with your audience\u2019s preferences for data presentation.\n\nThese features make it easier to analyze and share the results of array questions, providing meaningful visual feedback that can be utilized in reports or presented publicly.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

This will produce the pipe character, which is crucial for delineating endpoints in questions like the Semantic Differential.\n\n2. **Escaped Characters**: While formatting responses, ensure that you use correctly escaped characters or quotation marks, especially when including them in strings. This avoids errors during parsing and processing within the survey framework.\n\n3. **Testing the Input**: Always test your input to see how it renders in the survey preview. This helps identify any issues with special characters and ensures that respondents will see exactly what you expect.\n\nThese hints allow for improved accuracy and ease of creating questions involving special characters, ultimately minimizing errors during data collection and enhancing the overall respondent experience.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
