"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of the 'Short description' section in the document?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The 'Short description' section in the document serves as a concise introduction to the specific question type, detailing its primary function of collecting multiple lines of text input. It emphasizes the nature of the input expected from respondents, indicating that this format allows for extensive responses, enhancing qualitative data collection. Additionally, it provides a visual example through an embedded image and a downloadable file that illustrates the question type's implementation in a practical scenario.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the general options available for the multiple lines of text input question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The general options available for the multiple lines of text input question type include several functionality enhancements that control how the question operates and is presented to respondents:\n1. **Mandatory**: This setting requires respondents to provide an answer before they can proceed to the next question.\n2. **Relevance**: This option determines whether the question is displayed based on the responses to previous questions, ensuring that only relevant questions appear.\n3. **Preg Validation**: Enables specific validation rules for the inputs, ensuring that answers match predefined criteria or formats.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can the display options affect the user experience for the multiple lines of text input question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The display options significantly influence the user experience for the multiple lines of text input question type by enhancing usability and visual appeal. Key display options include:\n1. **Display Rows**: This setting allows you to specify how many rows of text will be visible to the user, impacting how the input area appears. A larger area can lead to better user engagement as respondents can see more of their input.\n2. **Hide Tip**: If activated, this option will prevent any instructional text from appearing with the question, which may be useful for minimizing clutter but might reduce clarity for respondents.\n3. **Text Input Width**: Adjusting the width of the input box can make it easier for users to read and interact with longer responses.\n4. **Input Box Size**: This option determines the overall dimensions of the answer box, which can significantly impact user comfort and the amount of text they are encouraged to enter.\nEach of these options should be tailored to the survey's objectives to provide a seamless user experience.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you describe how the input options such as 'maximum_chars' work in this text input question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The 'maximum_chars' input option defines the upper limit of characters that respondents can enter into the text field. This constraint is crucial for several reasons:\n1. **Data Management**: By limiting the number of characters, you reduce the risk of exceptionally long or irrelevant responses which can complicate data analysis and storage.\n2. **User Guidance**: Setting a limit helps guide respondents to provide concise answers, enhancing the quality and relevance of the data collected. It encourages them to focus on key points rather than rambling.\n3. **Validation**: This option can be paired with frontend validation to provide immediate feedback if a respondent attempts to exceed the character limit, improving the overall data entry experience.\nFor example, if a question allows a maximum of 200 characters, the interface can facilitate live character counting to inform users how many characters they have left as they type.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What does the 'Logic' section entail for the multiple lines of text input question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The 'Logic' section for the multiple lines of text input question type includes various settings that control the question's behavior based on respondent inputs or predefined conditions. The available options typically include:\n1. **Random Group**: This feature allows for randomization of the question ordering or grouping, which can help in reducing bias in responses by preventing any order effect that might influence how questions are perceived by respondents.\n2. **Validation Questions**: The options such as 'em_validation_q' and 'em_validation_sq' pertain to the use of additional validation questions that check the responses to ensure they meet certain logical criteria.\n3. **Validation Tips**: Related to the previous options, settings like 'em_validation_q_tip' provide guidance or hints about what constitutes a valid response, further clarifying expectations for respondents.\nThese logic settings are essential in surveys to ensure that the collected data is valid and applicable, enhancing the integrity of research findings.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How might the 'Statistics' section influence the analysis of the collected data?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The 'Statistics' section directly impacts how the collected data from the multiple lines of text input question type can be analyzed and visualized. Key features in this section include:\n1. **Display Chart**: This option allows users to visualize the collected responses in graphical formats, which can streamline data interpretation.\n2. **Chart Type**: This feature specifies the type of chart that will be used to represent the data, such as bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs. The choice of chart type can alter how effectively the data communicates trends or distributions.\nFor example, text responses can be summarized into categories, and visualizations can quickly reveal patterns or areas requiring further investigation. Having this section enhances the analytical capabilities of the survey tool and assists researchers in making data-driven decisions.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain how the 'Timer' settings function in this question type?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The 'Timer' settings in the multiple lines of text input question type provide control over time limits for respondents when answering questions. The following components are typically included:\n1. **Time Limit**: Establishes a fixed duration within which respondents must submit their answers. This setting can help keep the survey on schedule, which is particularly useful for lengthy surveys.\n2. **Time Limit Action**: Defines what happens when the time limit is reached, such as automatically moving to the next question or prompting an alert message.\n3. **Countdown Message**: Displays a notification to the respondents indicating how much time they have remaining, which can increase urgency and encourage quicker responses.\n4. **Warning Messages**: Various settings help inform respondents when they near the time limit, providing them additional context about remaining time.\nFor example, implementing these timer features can create a structured environment that ensures timely completion of the survey while also providing participants with context for their input's urgency.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
