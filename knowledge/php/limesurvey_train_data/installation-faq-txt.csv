"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can I fix an issue when I have a blank page after database creation in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""A common cause for a blank page after database creation in LimeSurvey can be an incorrect setting for `$rooturl` or `$rootdir` in the `config.php` file. This can happen when your LimeSurvey installation path is not correctly identified. To manually set it:\n1. Open `config.php` and locate the lines that set `$rooturl` and `$rootdir`.\n2. You may need to replace the automatic path detection with the actual path, for example:\n```php\n$rootdir = '/home/username/public_html/limesurvey';\n```\n3.
