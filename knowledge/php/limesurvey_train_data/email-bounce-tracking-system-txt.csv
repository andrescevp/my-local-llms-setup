"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How are bounces processed if using the LimeSurvey Cloud email server?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""If using the LimeSurvey Cloud email server, bounces are processed automatically without any additional configuration required from the user. The system uses a default sender address ('noreply@limesurvey.org') with a reply-to header pointing to the user's email, allowing for direct replies if needed. Once emails are sent out, the bounce tracking occurs in the background with no need for manual initiation.
