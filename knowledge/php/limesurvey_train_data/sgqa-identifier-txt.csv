It combines the unique IDs of the survey, group, and question into a single string format. This unique identifier is crucial for referencing answers in database queries and for dynamic scripting within the survey environment.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How is the SGQA identifier structured?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The structure of an SGQA identifier follows a specific format: it concatenates the IDs of the survey, group, and question with the letter 'X' in between them. For instance, if a survey has ID 745, a group has ID 35, and a question has ID 5, the SGQA identifier would be '745X35X5'. It is important to note that the 'X' must always be in capital letters.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How is the SGQA identifier formatted for multiple choice questions?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""For multiple choice questions, the SGQA identifier includes the regular format while also appending the particular answer code directly after the question identifier. For instance, if the survey ID is 1, group ID is 6, question ID is 12, and the particular answer code is 'ber1', the SGQA identifier would be formulated as:\n\n```plaintext\n1X6X12ber1\n``` \nThis allows for specific references to answers within multiple choice questions.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Describe the formatting rules for an SGQA identifier used with array questions.""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""When creating an SGQA identifier for array question types, it is essential to include not only the survey, group, and question identifiers but also the specific subquestion code. For example, if the survey ID is 1, group ID is 6, question ID is 12, and the subquestion code is 'ber1', the identifier will appear as follows: \n\n```plaintext\n1X6X12ber1\n``` \nThis allows the system to pinpoint the specific answer within the array question.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How should the identifier be formatted when handling combined array questions?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In the case of combined array questions, such as Array (Text) or Array (Number), the SGQA identifier is constructed by including the subquestion identifiers for both the row and the column. The format requires that you append an underscore between these codes. For example, if the survey ID is 1, group ID is 6, question ID is 12, the row subquestion code is 'ber1', and the column identifier is 'lab1', your identifier will look like:\n\n```plaintext\n1X6X12ber1_lab1\n``` \nThis signifies that the answer is linked to a specific subquestion in both dimensions of a matrix.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the practical uses of SGQA identifiers in LimeSurvey?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""SGQA identifiers have several practical applications in LimeSurvey, some of which include: \n1. **Loading Previous Answers**: SGQA identifiers can be used to reference and load answers from previously answered questions into the text of later questions.\n2. **Prefilling Survey Answers**: These identifiers can be included in the survey's query URL to prefill specific answers, providing a streamlined experience for respondents. For example:\n   \n   ```plaintext\n   &1X6X121ab1=Y\n   ```\n   This would 'prefill' the answer corresponding to SGQA '1X6X121ab1' with a 'Y'. \n3. **Database Reference**: Each identifier also acts as the field name where the corresponding data for each question is stored in the survey responses table, linking the survey logic directly to the database entries.""}]",knowledge/php/limesurvey,1.0,train
