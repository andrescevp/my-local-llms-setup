"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are Edge Side Includes and how do they work?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Edge Side Includes (ESI) are a technology that allows specific parts of a web page to have different caching strategies than the main page itself. Initially developed by Akamai in 2001, ESI enables the implementation of dynamic content on otherwise static web pages. This is particularly useful for pages that require updating dynamic sections like a shopping cart or user profile name without fully re-fetching the entire page.\n\nWhen a gateway cache receives a request for a page with ESI tags, it processes these ESI tags by either retrieving the included content from its own cache or fetching it from a backend server. In essence, ESI provides a way to embed separate page fragments into a main page, allowing these fragments to be fetched and cached independently.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What advantages does using ESI offer in a Symfony application?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Using Edge Side Includes (ESI) in a Symfony application has several advantages:\n\n1. **Improved Cache Management**: ESI allows for individual caching of page fragments, meaning parts of the page can have their own caching strategies. This flexibility enhances the performance of the application by reducing the amount of data that needs to be fetched repeatedly for static content.\n\n2. **Dynamic Content Handling**: With ESI, dynamic sections, like user-specific data or real-time feeds, can be updated without needing to reload the entire page. Clicks, actions, or updates affect only specific fragments, enhancing user experience.\n\n3. **Reduced Server Load**: Since the ESI-enabled gateway caches can serve cached fragments, there's less frequency in hitting the backend servers. This implies reduced load, especially during peak traffic, leading to better responsiveness and scalability.\n\n4. **Fallback Options**: If the ESI-enabled gateway cache is not present, Symfony will still merge the included content normally, allowing for graceful degradation rather than breaking functionality.\n\n5. **Fine-tuned Caching Policies**: ESI enables granular control over caching lifetimes for each component or fragment of the page which allows developers to define how long certain contents should be cached, ensuring fresh data when necessary.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

Specifically, instead of failing or producing an error, Symfony will merge the included page content into the main response as if the `render()` function was called instead of `render_esi()`. This is beneficial in the following ways:\n\n1. **Fallback to Normal Rendering**: The absence of a gateway cache will not break the application; it falls back to standard rendering logic, thus ensuring functionality remains intact.\n\n2. **Automatic Compatibility**: This mechanism allows the application to still function correctly in environments where a gateway cache might not be set up, thus avoiding unnecessary complexity for developers.\n\n3. **Maintain User Experience**: Even without ESI support, users will still receive the complete page response, although potentially without the performance benefits that come with ESI. This helps in maintaining user experience even in less than optimal conditions.\n\n4. **Cache Key Management**: Even in absence of gateway ESI, Symfony keeps track of cache keys, which can help if the gateway cache is added later to the system, allowing for smooth transitions and modifications in cache strategies.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
