By enabling this feature, when a user successfully authenticates, a cookie is created that keeps their session active beyond the typical expiration set for sessions. This prevents users from having to log in again each time they access the application, providing a more seamless user experience. The functionality supports various configurations, including setting cookie lifetime, enabling cookie creation on successful login, and customization of cookie properties.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

It is common to use the `%kernel.secret%` parameter for this purpose.\n2. **Lifetime**: Specify the `lifetime` which dictates how long (in seconds) the cookie is valid. For example, a lifetime of 604800 seconds means the cookies will last for one week.\n3. **Checkbox**: In your login form, include a checkbox input with the name `_remember_me` to allow users to opt-in for this feature.\n4. **Authenticator Support**: Ensure the authenticator used supports 'remember_me', possibly by implementing a `RememberMeBadge` in the authentication process.\n\nHere's an example configuration in YAML:\n```yaml\nsecurity:\n    firewalls:\n        main:\n            remember_me:\n                secret: '%kernel.secret%'\n                lifetime: 604800\n```""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the difference between signature-based tokens and persistent tokens in Symfony's 'remember me' system?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In Symfony's 'remember me' system, there are two main types of tokens used to validate the user's identity: signature-based tokens and persistent tokens:\n\n1. **Signature-Based Tokens**: These tokens include a signature that is generated based on user properties (like user ID and expiration timestamp). If any of these properties change, the signature becomes invalid, and the token cannot be used to authenticate the user. This means that they do not require additional storage, and their validity is inherently tied to user data changes, improving security.\n\n2. **Persistent Tokens**: Unlike signature-based tokens, persistent tokens are stored in a designated database, allowing for manual management and invalidation by altering associated database records. If an invalidation is required, administrators can simply change relevant rows, which facilitate better control over long-lived tokens, but require additional storage maintenance and management.\n\nChoosing between these two methods depends on the application's control needs and infrastructure capabilities.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
