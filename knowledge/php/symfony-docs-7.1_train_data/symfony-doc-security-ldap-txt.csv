Users submit their credentials through a form, and the server processes the login.\n   - `http_basic_ldap`: Employs HTTP Basic Authentication, where credentials are sent as part of the HTTP headers in each request. Users do not interact with a web form and are prompted for credentials by the browser.\n\n2. **State Management**:\n   - `form_login_ldap`: This can maintain a session for users post-authentication, allowing for stateful interactions with the application.\n   - `http_basic_ldap`: Usually does not maintain session state, as it is stateless; each request must contain the necessary authentication data.\n\n3. **Usage Context**:\n   - `form_login_ldap`: Generally suited for traditional web applications where users have a rich interaction via forms.\n   - `http_basic_ldap`: More commonly used in RESTful or API services where stateless authentication is required.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can you implement logging for LDAP operations in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To implement logging for LDAP operations in Symfony, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Use Symfony's Logging Component**: Symfony has a built-in logging component that can be configured to log LDAP operations. Install the Monolog bundle if it's not already included:\n   ```bash\n   composer require symfony/monolog-bundle\n   ```\n\n2. **Configure Logging Channels**: Define a logging channel in your `config/packages/monolog.yaml` file specifically for LDAP operations.
