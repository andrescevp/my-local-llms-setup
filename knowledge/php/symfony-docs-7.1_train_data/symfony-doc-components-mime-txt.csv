"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain the two ways of creating MIME messages in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Symfony provides two ways of creating MIME messages:\n\n1. **High-Level API**: This is based on the `Symfony\\Component\\Mime\\Email` class. This API allows for quick creation of email messages with common features. It simplifies the process by providing chainable methods to set up emails easily.\n   \n   Example of using the high-level API:\n   ```php\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Mime\\Email;\n   \n   $email = (new Email())\n       ->from('fabien@symfony.com')\n       ->to('foo@example.com')\n       ->subject('Important Notification')\n       ->text('Lorem ipsum...')\n       ->html('<h1>Lorem ipsum</h1> <p>...</p>');\n   ```\n   \n2. **Low-Level API**: This is based on the `Symfony\\Component\\Mime\\Message` class. It provides more control over every aspect of the email message, allowing developers to define each message part manually. This method is more complex and generally not recommended for typical emailing needs but is necessary for advanced applications needing absolute control.\n   \n   Example of using the low-level API:\n   ```php\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Mime\\Message;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Mime\\Part\\TextPart;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Mime\\Part\\Multipart\\AlternativePart;\n   \n   $textContent = new TextPart('Lorem ipsum...');\n   $htmlContent = new TextPart('<h1>Lorem ipsum</h1>', null, 'html');\n   $body = new AlternativePart($textContent, $htmlContent);\n   $message = new Message($headers, $body);\n   ```\nIn summary, the high-level API simplifies email creation while the low-level API caters to advanced custom messaging needs.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

It needs to be tagged with `mime.mime_type_guesser` so that the framework recognizes it as a guesser.\n3. **Use Autoconfiguration**: If you're using the default `services.yaml` configuration with autoconfiguration enabled, Symfony will automatically recognize and register your guesser based on the interface it implements.\nAdding a custom MIME type guesser can enhance the MIME type determination capabilities in your application, especially tailored to specific file formats or uses.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
