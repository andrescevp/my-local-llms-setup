"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can you implement lazy loading for commands in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To implement lazy loading for commands in Symfony, you can use the `FactoryCommandLoader` or `LazyCommand`. Here is how you could do it with `FactoryCommandLoader`:\n\n```php\nuse App\\Command\\HeavyCommand;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Application;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\CommandLoader\\FactoryCommandLoader;\n\n// Create a command loader with a factory for the HeavyCommand\n$commandLoader = new FactoryCommandLoader([\n    'app:heavy' => static fn(): Command => new HeavyCommand(),\n]);\n\n$application = new Application();\n$application->setCommandLoader($commandLoader);\n$application->run();\n```\nIn the above example, the `HeavyCommand` instance will only be created when the `app:heavy` command is invoked. Alternatively, you can use `LazyCommand`: \n\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\LazyCommand;\n\n$lazyCommand = new LazyCommand(\n    'app:heavy',\n    [],\n    'This is another more complete form of lazy command.',\n    false,\n    static fn (): Command => new HeavyCommand(),\n);\n\n$application->add($lazyCommand);\n$application->run();\n```""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the built-in command loaders provided by Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Symfony provides several built-in command loaders to facilitate command management:\n1. **FactoryCommandLoader**: This loader takes an array of `Command` factories as its constructor argument.

It allows commands to be defined in a container, reducing the need for manual service instantiation. Example:\n   ```php\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Console\\CommandLoader\\ContainerCommandLoader;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\ContainerBuilder;\n   \n   $container = new ContainerBuilder();\n   $container->register(FooCommand::class, FooCommand::class);\n   $container->compile();\n   \n   $commandLoader = new ContainerCommandLoader($container, [\n       'app:foo' => FooCommand::class,\n   ]);\n   ```\n   This way, executing the command will automatically fetch the appropriate service from the container.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What coding pattern does the lazy loading technique implement in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The lazy loading technique in Symfony implements the **Factory Pattern**. This design pattern defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. Essentially, it defers object creation until it's explicitly needed. \n\nHere's a brief overview of how lazy loading exemplifies this pattern:\n1. **Separation of Creation Logic**: Rather than hardcoding command instances, factories (functions or callable objects) are defined which contain the logic for instantiation.\n2. **Encapsulation**: The actual instantiation is encapsulated within the factory, meaning commands are created only on demand when the user calls them via the command line.\n3. **Flexibility**: It allows for great flexibility, as commands can include complex initialization logic in the factory method, while keeping the command loading and usage interface simple. \n\nFor example, the `FactoryCommandLoader` uses this pattern to instantiate commands only when asked:\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\CommandLoader\\FactoryCommandLoader;\n$commandLoader = new FactoryCommandLoader([\n    'app:foo' => function () { return new FooCommand(); },\n]);\n```""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
