This technique also takes advantage of modern PHP features, allowing for more expressive and concise code. For example:\n\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\Attribute\\Route;\n\nclass LuckyController\n{\n    #[Route('/lucky/number')]\n    public function number(): Response\n    {\n        // Implementation\n    }\n}\n```""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
