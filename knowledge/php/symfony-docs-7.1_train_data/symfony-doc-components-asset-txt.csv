"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Why is hardcoding URLs for assets considered a bad practice?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Hardcoding URLs for assets is considered a bad practice for several reasons:\n1. **Verbosity**: Templates become unnecessarily verbose because developers must repeatedly write full paths for each asset, which clutters the code.\n2. **Versioning Challenges**: Custom management of versioning becomes necessary, which complicates cache control, especially when assets need to be updated. The Asset component simplifies this process with built-in versioning strategies.\n3. **Cumbersome Relocation**: If assets need to be moved, all hardcoded paths must be updated manually across various templates, which is error-prone and time-consuming.\n4. **CDN Limitations**: Using multiple CDNs can be nearly impossible, as it requires changing asset URLs on each request.
