Use interfaces for service contracts.\n3. **Service Lifecycle**: Understand the lifecycle of a service (singleton, per-request, etc.) and how this impacts performance and behavior in the application.\n4. **Configuration Management**: Keep configuration simple and centralized, leveraging Symfony\u2019s service configuration capabilities to avoid code clutter.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How do you handle configuration parameters for services in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Handling configuration parameters for services in Symfony can be accomplished through defining parameters in configuration files and injecting them into services as needed. For example:\n1. Define parameters in `services.yaml`:\n```yaml\nparameters:\n    my_param: 'some_value'\n```\n2. Inject the parameter into a service:\n```yaml\nservices:\n    App\\Service\\MyService:\n        arguments:\n            $param: '%my_param%'\n```\nThis makes it easy to configure services dynamically based on environment-specific parameters while promoting reusable and descriptive service configurations.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
