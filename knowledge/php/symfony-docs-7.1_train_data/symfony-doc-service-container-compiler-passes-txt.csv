"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are tagged services in Symfony, and how can a compiler pass manipulate them?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Tagged services in Symfony are services that are registered with a specific tag name, allowing them to be grouped and processed collectively. They are particularly useful for allowing bundles or services to extend functionality dynamically based on certain criteria.\n\nTo manipulate tagged services within a compiler pass, you can implement the `process` method in your custom pass or in the `Kernel` class if it implements `CompilerPassInterface`. In this method, you can retrieve all services with a certain tag using `findTaggedServiceIds` and apply the necessary adjustments.\n\nExample of manipulating tagged services:\n\n```php\n// src/Kernel.php\nnamespace App;\n\nuse Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Kernel\\MicroKernelTrait;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\Compiler\\CompilerPassInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\ContainerBuilder;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Kernel as BaseKernel;\n\nclass Kernel extends BaseKernel implements CompilerPassInterface\n{\n    use MicroKernelTrait;\n\n    public function process(ContainerBuilder $container): void\n    {\n        foreach ($container->findTaggedServiceIds('some_tag') as $id => $tags) {\n            $definition = $container->getDefinition($id);\n            // Modify the definition or configuration as needed\n            $definition->setPublic(true);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code snippet, any service tagged with 'some_tag' is retrieved, allowing you to change properties such as visibility or other configurations.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

Accessing and modifying a private service within a compiler pass involves retrieving the service definition and altering its properties.

Use interfaces and service tags when possible.\n3. **Use Service Tags Efficiently**: Leverage service tags to categorize and process services without needing to know about them directly, which promotes decoupling.\n4. **Testing**: Write tests for your compiler passes to ensure that service modifications occur as intended during the container compilation.\n5. **Performance Considerations**: Since compiler passes run during the container compilation process, be conscious of their performance impact.
