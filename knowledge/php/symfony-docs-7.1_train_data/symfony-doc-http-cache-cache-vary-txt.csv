By specifying which headers the response varies upon, it allows caching systems to store different responses based on the values of those headers, effectively enabling multiple representations of a resource to be cached under the same URI. This is particularly useful when the content delivered depends on client capabilities or preferences, such as compression support indicated by the `Accept-Encoding` header.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What could happen if the Vary header is misconfigured?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""If the `Vary` header is misconfigured, it can lead to several caching issues. A primary risk is that users may receive an incorrect response for their request because the cache might not distinguish between different response versions based on the intended headers. For instance, a response meant for a client supporting compression may end up cached and served to a client that does not support it, leading to broken content or rendering issues. Furthermore, poor caching strategies could lead to increased server load as resources might not be served efficiently.
