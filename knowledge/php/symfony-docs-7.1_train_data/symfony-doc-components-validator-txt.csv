Each constraint represents a specific rule, such as length restrictions, uniqueness, or specific value requirements.\n\n2. **Validators**: These are the classes that contain the logic to enforce the constraints on the data. Validators check whether the given data complies with the rules defined by the constraints and report any violations.\n\nFor example, you might have a Length constraint to ensure a string is at least a certain number of characters long, and a corresponding validator that checks if the string meets this requirement.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can the `validate()` method assist in filtering violations by error code?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The `validate()` method returns a list of violations as an object that implements the `ConstraintViolationListInterface`. This allows you to interact with the validation results. If you have many validation errors, you can filter these violations based on specific error codes using the `findByCodes` method. \n\nFor example, if you are validating an entity for uniqueness, you can do the following:\n\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Bridge\\Doctrine\\Validator\\Constraints\\UniqueEntity;\n\n$violations = $validator->validate(/* ... */);\nif (0 !== count($violations->findByCodes(UniqueEntity::NOT_UNIQUE_ERROR))) {\n    // handle this specific error (display a message, send an email, etc.)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we filter the violations to check if there are any related to the uniqueness constraint, making it easier to handle specific validation issues.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
