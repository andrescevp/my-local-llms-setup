If credentials are invalid, it can throw an `AuthenticationException` to signal failure.\n\n3. **Creating the Passport**: After successful validation, the method constructs a `Passport` object that includes a `UserBadge`, which identifies the user, and can also include additional credential information (like passwords or tokens).\n\nExample implementation of the `authenticate()` method in an API key context:\n```php\npublic function authenticate(Request $request): Passport\n{\n    $apiToken = $request->headers->get('X-AUTH-TOKEN');\n    if (null === $apiToken) {\n        throw new CustomUserMessageAuthenticationException('No API token provided');\n    }\n    // Logic to validate apiToken and retrieve user identifier\n    $userIdentifier = /** your logic here **/;\n    return new SelfValidatingPassport(new UserBadge($userIdentifier));\n}\n```\nThis method enables the effective execution of the authentication process and plays an integral part in ensuring that only valid users can access protected resources.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

For example, if API tokens are used, the authenticator would verify this token against a storage system that maps tokens to users.\n\n3. **Using Credential Classes**: Symfony provides various credential classes that can be used depending on the required logic, such as `PasswordCredentials` for password verification or `CustomCredentials` for personalized checks. An example is shown below:\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Http\\Authenticator\\Passport\\Credentials\\PasswordCredentials;\n$passport = new Passport(new UserBadge($email), new PasswordCredentials($plaintextPassword));\n```\n4. **Return Passport**: Finally, upon successful validation, a `Passport` object encapsulating both the user state and credentials is returned to signify a successful authentication step.\n\nExample for custom API token verification:\n```php\npublic function authenticate(Request $request): Passport\n{\n    $apiToken = $request->headers->get('X-AUTH-TOKEN');\n    // Validate token and retrieve user\n    return new Passport(new UserBadge($email), new CustomCredentials(...));\n}\n```\nThus, processing credentials in an authenticator enables fine-grained control over how authentication is handled, creating customized behaviors for various authentication strategies.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
