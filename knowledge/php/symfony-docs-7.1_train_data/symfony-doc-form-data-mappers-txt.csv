This allows each part of the form to maintain its own input state, which enhances the interactivity and functionality of forms in web applications.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How do data transformers differ from data mappers in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Data transformers and data mappers serve different purposes in Symfony forms. A **data transformer** is responsible for changing the representation of a single value, such as converting a string date like '2016-08-12' into a `DateTime` object. In contrast, a **data mapper** handles mapping data between an object or an array and multiple form fields as a whole, allowing for data organization within compound types. For instance, a single `DateTime` instance can populate various inner fields of a date type form. Therefore, while transformers deal with individual data transformations, mappers focus on the mapping of structured data.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
