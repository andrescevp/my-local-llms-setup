When a controller is defined as a service, Symfony automatically injects any necessary dependencies into the controller's constructor based on type hints.

Controllers should delegate responsibilities to services wherever applicable.\n\n6. **Simplicity**: Keep controller methods concise. If a method starts getting complex, consider extracting portions of the logic into private methods or service calls.\n\n7. **Type-Hinting and Return Types**: Utilize PHP type hinting for method parameters and return types.
