For example, transforming an array of tags into a comma-separated string when displaying a form, and converting it back to an array when the form is submitted. \n- **Data Mappers**: In contrast, data mappers are responsible for mapping values to form fields, typically when you need to manage multiple fields as a single object. They help coordinate the interaction between a model object and the form fields, making sure that data is correctly set for each field during the rendering and submission processes.

Here's an example of transforming an array of tags into a string and back:\n\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\CallbackTransformer;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\Extension\\Core\\Type\\TextType;\n\n$builder->get('tags')\n    ->addModelTransformer(new CallbackTransformer(\n        function ($tagsAsArray): string {\n            return implode(', ', $tagsAsArray);\n        },\n        function ($tagsAsString): array {\n            return explode(', ', $tagsAsString);\n        }\n    ));\n```\n\nIn this case, the `CallbackTransformer` converts an array of tags into a comma-separated string when rendering the form, and back to an array of tags when processing the form submission.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

This means your model transformer cannot remove items from the collection; doing so could leave it in an invalid state with empty or undefined children that the form won't handle properly.\n3. **Utilizing DTOs**: Consider using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) if your transformation requires complex manipulation of the model data structure or if you need to accommodate different representations of similar data. DTOs can provide a buffer between what the form expects and what the underlying model provides, helping maintain integrity during transformations.\n4. **Validation Considerations**: Make sure to implement proper validation methods considering how data is modified.

It sits between the model data and view data types, providing a standard format that the form can utilize during its processing.

The `transform()` method of a model transformer processes model objects and converts them into normalized data, while the `reverseTransform()` method does the opposite, bringing normalized data back into the model format.\n2. **Common Data Handling**: Normalized data is generally simpler and more uniform, allowing forms to handle various types of user inputs consistently. For instance, when handling dates, the normalized form may require a consistent string format regardless of how a user inputs it.\n3. **Data Integrity**: By using normalization, Symfony forms ensure data integrity throughout the process. Validations can be performed on normalized data to ensure that it meets specific criteria before being converted back to the model, thus preserving the integrity of the application's data layer.\n4. **Simplification of Data Management**: Normalization provides a simplified structure that allows form handling to be decoupled from the logic of the business objects.

When this happens, throw a `TransformationFailedException` with a clear, developer-oriented message for logging or debugging purposes.\n\n```php\nif ($issue === null) {\n    throw new TransformationFailedException('Issue not found.');\n}\n```\n\n2. **Setting Invalid Messages**: Use `setInvalidMessage()` on the exception instance to set a user-friendly error message that will be shown in the form.
