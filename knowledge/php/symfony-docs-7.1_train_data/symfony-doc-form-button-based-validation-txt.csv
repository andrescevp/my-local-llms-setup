This class should contain the logic to determine the validation groups based on submitted data or context.\n2. Inject this service into your form type.\n3. Use the form event listener to set the validation groups dynamically during form processing.\n\nHere\u2019s an example:\n\n```php\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\FormBuilderInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\FormEvent;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\FormEvents;\n\nclass TaskType extends AbstractType\n{\n    private $validationGroupService;\n\n    public function __construct(ValidationGroupService $validationGroupService)\n    {\n        $this->validationGroupService = $validationGroupService;\n    }\n\n    public function buildForm(FormBuilderInterface $builder, array $options)\n    {\n        $builder->addEventListener(FormEvents::PRE_SUBMIT, function (FormEvent $event) {\n            $data = $event->getData();\n            $form = $event->getForm();\n\n            if (isset($data['previousStep'])) {\n                $form->setData($data);\n                $form->getConfig()->setOption('validation_groups', $this->validationGroupService->getPreviousStepValidationGroups($data));\n            } else {\n                $form->getConfig()->setOption('validation_groups', $this->validationGroupService->getNextStepValidationGroups($data));\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, based on whether `previousStep` or another button was clicked, the appropriate validation groups can be set dynamically.

These checks are typically integrated directly into the form components, ensuring they cannot be bypassed entirely:\n\n1. **File Uploads**: Symfony checks file size limits and types based on the configuration you supply. If a user tries to upload a file that exceeds defined constraints, the form will still return an error.\n2. **Type Mismatches**: For fields that expect a certain type (like numbers), if a string is submitted that cannot convert to a number, validation will trigger an error, even without custom rules.\n3. **Customizable**: While you can suppress custom validations for user experience, these foundational checks still run to maintain database integrity and user feedback during form submissions.\n\nThus, Symfony protects data integrity by ensuring these basic validations happen automatically, allowing for a smoother yet secure form submission process.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

If critical data validation checks can be circumvented, this could lead to inconsistencies or errors in subsequent steps.\n\n3. **Type Safety**: Ensure that foundational validation checks remain intact. It's vital that basic integrity constraints (like ensuring numbers are numeric or file uploads are within size limits) are still validated, as these protect against major issues down the line.\n\n4. **Business Requirements**: Understand the business logic behind data entry. If certain steps or data fields require validation due to regulatory constraints (e.g., personal information), consider whether skipping validation is appropriate.\n\n5. **Testing and Scenarios**: Rigorously test forms under various scenarios to identify potential flaws or data corruption that might arise when validation is allowed to be bypassed.
