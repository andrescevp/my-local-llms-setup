By using this method, you can instruct the sanitizer to tailor the sanitization process for particular HTML tags such as `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<textarea>`. This helps in applying different sanitization rules based on where the sanitized content will be used. For instance:\n\n```php\n$safeInput = $htmlSanitizer->sanitizeFor('head', $userInput); // Removes tags not allowed in <head>\n$safeInput = $htmlSanitizer->sanitizeFor('title', $userInput); // Encodes the returned HTML using HTML entities\n``` \nUsing `sanitizeFor`, developers ensure that the resulting HTML is valid and follows the expected structure for the specified context.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
