Any mistakes could result in unexpected logging behavior, like missing logs or logs being sent to the wrong handlers.\n3. **Performance Considerations**: Having multiple handlers configured with extensive filtering may introduce performance overhead due to the additional processing required to check channel conditions.\n4. **Revisiting Configurations**: As your application evolves, regularly revisit and update your logging configurations to align with new channels and logging needs, ensuring that your logs remain effective and relevant.\n\nBy keeping these considerations in mind, you can effectively manage logging behavior in your Symfony applications.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
