These expressions are instances of the `Symfony\\Component\\ExpressionLanguage\\Expression` class, allowing developers to define complex rules using logical operators and built-in functions. For example, you can check if a user has specific roles or if a user meets certain conditions:\n\n```php\n#[IsGranted(new Expression('is_granted(\""ROLE_ADMIN\"") or is_granted(\""ROLE_MANAGER\"")'))]\npublic function show(): Response {\n    // ...\n}\n```\nIn this case, access is granted if the user has either the `ROLE_ADMIN` or `ROLE_MANAGER`.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
