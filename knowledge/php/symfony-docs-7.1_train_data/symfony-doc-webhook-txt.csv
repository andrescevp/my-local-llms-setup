Webhooks eliminate the need for polling by providing data only when there are updates, thereby saving bandwidth and reducing server load.\n3. **Decoupled Architecture**: Using webhooks encourages a more decoupled architecture, allowing different services or components to communicate without tightly coupling their implementations. This results in greater flexibility and scalability for applications.\n4. **Enhanced Integration Capabilities**: Webhooks facilitate seamless integration with third-party services, enabling applications to react to a broad array of events across different platforms, such as payment confirmations, email notifications, and more.\n5. **Lower Latency**: Since webhooks trigger requests in real-time, they generally provide lower latency responses compared to fetching data with polling, making applications more responsive.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

This event is then dispatched through Symfony's event dispatcher system.\n4. **Consumer Invocation**: The associated consumer class (which implements the `ConsumerInterface`) listens for these dispatched events and reacts accordingly in its `consume` method, applying the defined business logic to handle the incoming event appropriately.\n5. **Error Handling**: Throughout this process, Symfony allows for error handling mechanisms, including logging and responding gracefully to invalid requests or exceptions.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
