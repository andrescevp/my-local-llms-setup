Unlike annotations, which are parsed at runtime and require additional parsing libraries or tools, attributes are a native part of PHP and are declared using a simple syntax. Attributes provide a way to add metadata to classes, methods, and properties in a more efficient and standardized manner. Since they are part of the language, attributes improve performance, ease of use, and integration with other PHP features, making Symfony components more robust and maintainable.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can Symfony attributes be used to facilitate event-driven architecture?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Symfony attributes, particularly those like `AsEventListener` and `AsRemoteEventConsumer`, significantly facilitate event-driven architecture by allowing services to automatically subscribe to events or listen for remote triggers.
