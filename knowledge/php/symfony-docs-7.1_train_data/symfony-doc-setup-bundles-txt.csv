This means that if bundles are using deprecated features from Symfony 2.8, they won't work with Symfony 3, potentially breaking applications that attempt to upgrade.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

This constraint indicates that the bundle is compatible with any future version of Symfony, which can lead to unexpected behavior or incompatibilities as new versions are released. Instead, constraints like \""~2.N|~3.0\"" or \""^2.N|~3.0\"" ensure that the bundle works with defined major versions, making it more reliable and future-proof.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

The Official Symfony Guide provides a comprehensive list of changes required to upgrade from version 2.x to 3.x, categorized by the component, making it straightforward to locate necessary modifications. \nThe SensioLabs DeprecationDetector, on the other hand, runs a static code analysis on your project's source code to identify usages of deprecated methods, classes, and interfaces. It specifically caters to Symfony applications, making the detection process tailored and efficient. Together, they help developers understand and address deprecated features effectively during an upgrade.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
