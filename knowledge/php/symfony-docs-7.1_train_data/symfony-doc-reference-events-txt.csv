"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How do Symfony services and events interact?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Symfony services and events interact by allowing services to define behavior linked to specific events. Listeners, which are often defined as services, respond to dispatched events and encapsulate the logic related to those events. By injecting dependencies into listeners, you can access different parts of the application or engage services that perform specific tasks when events occur. This enables you to build rich, modular applications where event-driven behavior is easily manageable and testable.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
