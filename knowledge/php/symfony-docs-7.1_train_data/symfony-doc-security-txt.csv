Follow the prompts:\n   - Name of the security user class (e.g., User): `User`\n   - Do you want to store user data in the database (via Doctrine)? (yes/no): `yes`\n   - Enter a unique display name property (e.g., email, username): `email`\n   - Will the app hash/check user passwords? (yes/no): `yes`\n\nThis will generate the following example code for your user class:\n\n```php\n// src/Entity/User.php\nnamespace App\\Entity;\n\nuse Doctrine\\ORM\\Mapping as ORM;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\UserInterface;\n\n#[ORM\\Entity]\nclass User implements UserInterface, PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface\n{\n    #[ORM\\Id]\n    #[ORM\\GeneratedValue]\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'integer')]\n    private int $id;\n\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'string', length: 180, unique: true)]\n    private ?string $email;\n\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'json')]\n    private array $roles = [];\n\n    #[ORM\\Column(type: 'string')]\n    private string $password;\n\n    // ...

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of the Symfony role hierarchy?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The purpose of the Symfony role hierarchy is to simplify the management of user roles and permissions by allowing roles to inherit from one another.

For example, if `ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN` inherits `ROLE_ADMIN`, it automatically obtains all permissions associated with `ROLE_ADMIN`.\n3. **Prevent Role Explosion**: Instead of assigning multiple individual roles to users, administrators can assign broader roles that encompass necessary permissions, reducing complexity.\n\nRole hierarchy is defined in `security.yaml` like this:\n```yaml\nsecurity:\n    role_hierarchy:\n        ROLE_ADMIN: ROLE_USER\n        ROLE_SUPER_ADMIN: [ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_ALLOWED_TO_SWITCH]\n``` \nThis structure ensures that roles are manageable and intuitive, streamlining user permission management.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
