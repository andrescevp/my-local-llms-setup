By allowing expressions to define dynamic rules and behaviors, developers can avoid modifying the codebase directly for changes in business logic.\n\nThis separation between business rules and application logic leads to cleaner code, easier maintenance, and the potential for improved collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders. As a result, reducing technical debt allows for a more sustainable codebase that is easier to extend and modify over time.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
