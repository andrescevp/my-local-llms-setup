Each character is represented by a code point, which is a number that corresponds to a specific character or symbol defined in the Unicode standard (e.g., the code point for the letter 'A' is U+0041).\n- **Grapheme Clusters**: These represent sequences of one or more code points that are visually represented as a single character. For example, the Spanish letter '\u00f1' consists of two code points (U+006E for 'n' and U+0303 for the combining tilde). Grapheme clusters are used to correctly display characters that can be composed of multiple code points.\n- **Bytes**: These are the raw binary representations of the characters in a string. Different encoding standards (like UTF-8, UTF-16) define how code points are stored in bytes, with some code points potentially requiring one or more bytes depending on their values and the encoding used.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
