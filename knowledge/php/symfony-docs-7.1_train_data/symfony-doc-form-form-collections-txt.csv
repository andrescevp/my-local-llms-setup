Delegate the responsibility of maintaining relationships, like adding or removing items in a collection, back to the entity methods. This maintains cleaner and more manageable code.\n\n4. **Validate Relationships**: Ensure that when you're adding or removing entities in a relationship, you're validating that changes won't violate your data integrity. For example, check whether a tag already exists before adding it to avoid duplicates.\n\n5. **Optimize Performance**: Be mindful of database performance when dealing with relationships, particularly in large datasets. Load only the data you need using joins or specify fetch strategies where necessary to avoid loading unnecessary data.\n\n6. **Document Relationships**: Clearly document your entity relationships and the expected behavior of your methods.

This means that changes made in the form (such as additions or removals of items) will update the existing collection directly. However, it also implies that Symfony will not call the adder and remover methods of the entity, bypassing any custom logic you may have intended to include in those methods. This might lead to issues, especially if you have business logic that needs to be executed every time an entity is added or removed, such as updating inverse relationships or validating data.\n\n- **When set to `false`**: Symfony will call the adder and remover methods instead of modifying the underlying collection directly. This allows for better encapsulation of your business logic when managing relationships. For instance, if you implemented an `addTag(Tag $tag): void` method that also manages the corresponding inverse relationship, setting `by_reference` to `false` ensures that this method will be triggered with each modification of the collection.\n\nOverall, setting `by_reference` to `false` is generally recommended, especially when using collections in a more complex entity relationship, ensuring business logic is consistently applied.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

Ensure you manage the removal properly based on your persistence layer's requirements.\n\n5. **Form Submission**: If you don't remove the item from the DOM before submitting the form, Doctrine will interpret it as if the item is still present in the collection, leading to potential mismatches in the data assumptions between your application state and the database.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

If the token is missing or invalid, Symfony raises an exception, preventing the form from being processed. This stops unauthorized submissions from untrusted sources.\n\n4. **Session-based Security Measures**: This protection mechanism relies on the user's session, making it difficult for attackers to predict or forge requests, as they would need to have a valid token that is only generated per session.\n\nBy utilizing these features, Symfony greatly reduces vulnerability to CSRF attacks when dealing with forms in applications.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
