When an order transitions to a 'shipped' state, a workflow event can trigger an external shipping service API to dispatch the order. It might look like this:\n1. **Transition**: Order state changes to 'shipped'.\n2. **Event Listener**: The workflow dispatches an event that calls a listener.\n3. **External Service Interaction**: The listener then makes an API call to the shipping provider, notifying them of the shipment.\n\nThis integration allows for automated updates and actions across systems, enhancing overall application efficiency.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
