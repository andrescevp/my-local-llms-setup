It's advisable to use a common `composer.json` for both applications to manage dependencies effectively.\n3. **Global State Refactoring**: Refactor the existing application to remove reliance on global state, which is considered an anti-pattern. This helps avoid side effects when the Symfony application is introduced.\n4. **Testing Framework**: Establish a safety net through automated tests to ensure that existing features don't break during the migration.

If upgrading the legacy project to a newer PHP version is necessary, plan accordingly.\n3. **Library Support**: Check library and bundle compatibility with the Symfony version being targeted. Certain dependencies may restrict your choice.\n4. **Future Maintenance**: Consider how often you will need to update the application based on your choice of version to receive security patches and bugs fixes.

Convert global state management into service instances that can be injected where necessary.\n4. **Testing**: As part of the migration, create tests to ensure that refactoring does not break existing functionality. Automated tests will help ensure that global state changes do not introduce bugs.\n5. **Monitor Legacy Application**: While the Symfony application takes over user requests, monitor and log any issues caused by shared state to identify conflicts early and tackle them accordingly.\nBy systematically managing and reducing global state reliance, you can ensure a smoother migration and better integration between the legacy and new Symfony applications.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the two commonly used approaches to integrate legacy applications with Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The two commonly used approaches to integrate legacy applications with Symfony during migration are:\n1. **Front Controller with Legacy Bridge**: This approach involves using Symfony's front controller (e.g., `public/index.php`) to handle all requests. If Symfony cannot process a given route, control is passed to a `LegacyBridge` class that determines which legacy script to execute. This approach maintains the legacy application's structure while gradually allowing Symfony to take over handling requests. It provides access to Symfony features within the legacy application by making the Symfony kernel globally accessible.\n   - Pros: Minimizes impact on the legacy application. Allows phased migration of features from the legacy system to Symfony.\n   - Cons: May lead to some redundant code as both systems operate independently.\n\n2. **Legacy Route Loader**: In this method, legacy application logic is integrated directly into Symfony by creating a custom route loader. This loader registers legacy routes which map to the original scripts, and the routing system handles requests to these scripts from within Symfony. This integrates the legacy application closely with Symfony's routing and event system.\n   - Pros: Better integration with Symfony.
