Here's an example of implementing setter injection in a Symfony service using the `setLogger` method:\n\n1. **Service Definition**: Define your service in the `services.yaml` file and specify that it should call the `setLogger` method with a logger service injected:\n\n```yaml\n# config/services.yaml\nservices:\n    App\\Service\\MessageGenerator:\n        # ...\n        calls:\n            - setLogger: ['@logger']\n```\n\n2. **The Service Class**: The `MessageGenerator` class would look like this:\n\n```php\nnamespace App\\Service;\n\nuse Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface;\n\nclass MessageGenerator\n{\n    private LoggerInterface $logger;\n\n    public function setLogger(LoggerInterface $logger): void\n    {\n        $this->logger = $logger;\n    }\n\n    // Other methods utilizing the logger\n}\n```\n\nThis demonstrates how to utilize setter injection to inject a logger after the service is instantiated.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What considerations should be taken into account when using immutable setters?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""When using immutable setters in Symfony, there are several considerations to keep in mind:\n1. **Cloning Overhead**: Cloning an instance every time a property changes can incur performance costs, especially for complex objects.

You might end up with many variations of an object, which can complicate your design.\n3. **Memory Usage**: Every time a property is set, a new instance is created, which could lead to increased memory usage if not managed properly, especially if the service instances are large.\n4. **Potentially Increased Cognitive Load**: For developers who are accustomed to mutable objects, immutable patterns may introduce a steeper learning curve and require changes in approach when managing object states.\n5. **Thread Safety**: Immutable objects can provide benefits in multi-threaded environments by eliminating race conditions and ensuring that objects cannot be modified after creation. This can be a significant advantage where concurrency is a concern.\nOverall, while immutable setters can enhance object integrity and reduce side effects, careful consideration is required to ensure that they are used effectively without introducing performance or complexity issues.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

This allows dependencies to be set after instantiation.\n\n2. **Service Configuration**: In `services.yaml`, define services using the calls configuration to specify the setter methods for optional dependencies.
