This allows for greater flexibility in object instantiation, especially when complex initialization is required or when instances depend on varying configurations. By using a factory, you can encapsulate the instantiation logic and parameters required by your service, making your code cleaner and adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the difference between static and non-static factories in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In Symfony, a **static factory** refers to a factory method that is defined as a static method within a class.

This can be useful when the factory needs to maintain state or requires dependency injections for its own construction.
