"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of the PSR-3 logger in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The PSR-3 logger in Symfony serves as a standardized interface for logging messages. This logger is integrated into the Symfony framework via the `Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Log\\Logger` class. It allows developers to log messages at various levels (like INFO, WARNING, ERROR, etc.) to specified outputs (like files, email, etc.). Following the twelve-factor app methodology, the logger in Symfony sends messages starting from the WARNING level to the standard error stream (stderr) by default. This promotes a uniform logging interface across different applications and libraries, enabling easier debugging and troubleshooting.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are some advantages of using placeholders in log messages?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Using placeholders in log messages provides several advantages:\n1. **Easier Log Analysis**: Logging tools often aggregate messages with the same format but different variable values, which allows for easier identification and analysis of patterns in log data.\n2. **Localization Support**: Placeholder-based messages can be more easily translated into different languages without altering the overall log structure, promoting better internationalization.\n3. **Improved Security**: When values are passed as placeholders, they can be properly escaped by the logging mechanism, reducing the risk of log injection attacks or improperly handled data exposure.\n\nFor example, instead of logging:\n```php\n$logger->info('User 12345 has logged in');\n```\nYou would use:  \n```php\n$logger->info('User {userId} has logged in', ['userId' => 12345]);\n```\nThis approach helps maintain clarity and integrity within your logging strategy.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

When you install the `symfony/monolog-bundle`, you can configure how log messages are created and stored, leveraging Monolog's handlers and features.

Different types serve different purposes and can greatly affect how logs are managed and stored.\n4. **Performance**: Evaluate the performance impact, especially on production systems, to prevent logging from becoming a bottleneck. Consider whether logs can be sent to external systems for further analysis.\n5. **Backup and Rotation**: Implement log rotation and consider retention policies to prevent logs from consuming excessive storage space over time.
