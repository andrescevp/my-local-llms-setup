"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can a custom version strategy for assets be implemented in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To implement a custom version strategy for assets in Symfony, you will need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. **Create a Version Strategy Class**: Implement the `VersionStrategyInterface` in your PHP class. This interface requires methods to retrieve the asset version and to apply that version to the asset path.\n\n   Below is an example of a custom version strategy class:\n   ```php\n   namespace App\\Asset\\VersionStrategy;\n   \n   use Symfony\\Component\\Asset\\VersionStrategy\\VersionStrategyInterface;\n   \n   class GulpBusterVersionStrategy implements VersionStrategyInterface\n   {\n       private string $format;\n       private array $hashes;\n       \n       public function __construct(private string $manifestPath, ?string $format = null)\n       {\n           $this->format = $format ?: '%s?%s';\n       }\n\n       public function getVersion(string $path): string\n       {\n           if (!is_array($this->hashes)) {\n               $this->hashes = $this->loadManifest();\n           }\n           return $this->hashes[$path] ??
