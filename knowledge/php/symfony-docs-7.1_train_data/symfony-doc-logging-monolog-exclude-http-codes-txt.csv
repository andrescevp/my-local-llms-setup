You can execute the following command to see all the registered services and their parameters, including those for Monolog:\n\n```shell\nphp bin/console debug:container monolog\n```\nThis command will show you the details of the Monolog configuration, helping you verify the handlers and excluded HTTP codes.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you give an example of how to log an exception in Monolog with certain HTTP codes excluded?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Certainly! To log an exception in Monolog while ensuring that certain HTTP codes are excluded, you might do something like the following in a Symfony controller:\n\n```php\nuse Psr\\Log\\LoggerInterface;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\Exception\\HttpException;\n\nclass YourController\n{\n    private LoggerInterface $logger;\n\n    public function __construct(LoggerInterface $logger)\n    {\n        $this->logger = $logger;\n    }\n\n    public function yourAction(): Response\n    {\n        try {\n            // Your code that could throw an exception\n            throw new HttpException(404, 'Page not found');\n        } catch (HttpException $e) {\n            // This exception will be logged based on your Monolog configuration\n            $this->logger->error('An error occurred: ' . $e->getMessage(), ['exception' => $e]);\n        }\n\n        return new Response('Handled', 200);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, if you have `404` codes set to excluded in your Monolog configuration, they will not be logged when this exception occurs. If you were handling a different HTTP code not marked for exclusion, it would appear in your logs.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the purpose of the fingers_crossed handler in Monolog?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The `fingers_crossed` handler in Monolog is used for conditional logging; it collects log records until a specific log level appears, at which point it triggers logging of all collected records. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you want to minimize log entries unless a serious issue arises. For example, if you set it to log upon receiving an `error` level message, all previous records below this level remain unlogged until an error occurs. Additionally, you can configure it to exclude specific HTTP error codes, excluding frequent or irrelevant logs from being captured.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can excluded_http_codes be used to manage log verbosity?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""`excluded_http_codes` can be effectively employed to manage log verbosity by filtering out less significant HTTP error codes that are common and might clutter your logs, such as 404 or 403 errors. By specifying these codes in the `excluded_http_codes` array within your Monolog handler configuration, you ensure that they are ignored, which reduces the amount of logged data and helps in focusing on the more critical issues that need attention. This is especially beneficial in production environments where you want to keep logs clear and relevant, tracking only the significant events that impact application performance or user experience.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is a potential pitfall when configuring Monolog for HTTP code exclusions?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""A potential pitfall in configuring Monolog for HTTP code exclusions is the proper management of the `passthru_level`. If the `passthru_level` is set to a value lower than `error`, any HTTP codes that fall into the specified excluded list will still be logged because they meet or exceed the error log level. For instance, if `passthru_level` is set to `warning`, logs for error-level messages (including excluded HTTP codes) will still be captured and logged, which defeats the purpose of explicitly defining exclusions. Thus, ensuring alignment between the excluded codes and the logging level is critical for achieving the intended log management.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can I exclude HTTP codes based on URL patterns in Monolog?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Yes, in Monolog, you can exclude HTTP codes based on URL patterns using the `excluded_http_codes` configuration option. By specifying a mapping of HTTP codes to URL patterns, you can tailor your logging strategy to ignore certain errors depending on the request path. For example, the configuration `excluded_http_codes: [403, 404, { 400: ['^/foo', '^/bar'] }]` indicates that 403 and 404 responses should be excluded from logs, and 400 errors should only be logged if they originate from URLs that do not match `/foo` or `/bar`. This flexibility allows for granular log management based on application requirements.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
