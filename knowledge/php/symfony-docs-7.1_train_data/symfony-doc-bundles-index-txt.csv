"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can configurations be done within a Symfony Bundle?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Configuration in a Symfony Bundle is managed primarily through service definitions and parameters. Here\u2019s how to do it effectively:\n1. **Create `Services.yaml`**: Define your services and their dependencies in a `Services.yaml` file located in `Resources/config/`. \n   Example:\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n       MyBundle\\Service\\MyService:\n           arguments:\n               $someDependency: '@Some\\Service'\n   ```\n2. **Load Configurations**: In your bundle's `Extension` class, utilize the `ContainerBuilder` to load your service configurations, which might look like:\n   ```php\n   namespace MyBundle\\DependencyInjection;\n\n   use Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\ContainerBuilder;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\Extension\\Extension;\n\n   class MyBundleExtension extends Extension\n   {\n       public function load(array $configs, ContainerBuilder $container)\n       {\n           $configuration = new Configuration();\n           $config = $this->processConfiguration($configuration, $configs);\n           // Load services.yaml\n           $loader = new YamlFileLoader($container, new FileLocator(__DIR__.'/../Resources/config'));\n           $loader->load('services.yaml');\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Configuration Files**: If your bundle requires custom configuration, create a `Configuration.php` class to define the options available for the user. \nUsing these methods allows the bundle's functionality to be configurable without hardcoding values, fostering adaptability.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is an override in the context of Symfony Bundles?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In Symfony, overriding typically refers to customizing or replacing default services, templates, or configurations defined within a bundle.
