"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can you override the default error templates in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To override the default error templates in Symfony, you can use the built-in Twig error renderer. First, ensure that the `TwigBundle` and `TwigBridge` are installed by running the following command:\n```bash\n$ composer require symfony/twig-pack\n```\n\nNext, create the custom error templates inside the directory `templates/bundles/TwigBundle/Exception/`. For example, if you want to create a custom 404 error page, you would place your `error404.html.twig` file in that directory with your desired content. A typical structure would look like:\n\n```text\ntemplates/\n\u2514\u2500 bundles/\n   \u2514\u2500 TwigBundle/\n      \u2514\u2500 Exception/\n         \u251c\u2500 error404.html.twig\n         \u251c\u2500 error403.html.twig\n         \u2514\u2500 error.html.twig  # All other HTML errors)\n```\nThis allows Symfony to use your custom templates instead of the default ones.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
