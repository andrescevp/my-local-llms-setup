They centralize all permission logic, allowing reuse in various parts. When a permission check is triggered using methods like `isGranted()` or `denyAccessUnlessGranted()` in a controller, Symfony calls all registered voters to make an access decision. Each voter returns a response indicating whether the user has the required permissions based on the defined logic. The ultimate decision is made according to a defined strategy, which can be affirmative, consensus, unanimous, or priority, ensuring a flexible and organized approach to authorization.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

If you have simple access checks that don't require the overhead of voters, it may be more efficient to handle them directly in your controller action. For example, ensuring that only the owner of a post can access certain functionalities could be checked with a simple condition in the controller, like this:\n```php\nif ($post->getOwner() !== $this->getUser()) {\n    throw $this->createAccessDeniedException();\n}\n``` This is efficient for straightforward cases.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

To create a custom voter, a developer must implement this interface or extend the `Voter` class, allowing them to define their own logic for authorization.

By returning true, it indicates that the voter will participate in the decision.\n2. **voteOnAttribute(string $attribute, mixed $subject, TokenInterface $token): bool** - Once `supports` returns true, this method is called to evaluate the actual permission logic, returning true to grant access or false to deny it.

When voters are cacheable, Symfony will avoid calling them multiple times for the same checks, thus reducing overhead in applications with frequent permission checks.
