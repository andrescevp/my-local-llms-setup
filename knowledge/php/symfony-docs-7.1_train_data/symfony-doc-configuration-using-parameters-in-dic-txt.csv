"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you describe a situation where you might utilize `%kernel.debug%` in configuration?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Certainly! Utilizing `%kernel.debug%` in configuration is common in scenarios where logging or debugging behavior needs to be adjusted based on the environment (development vs. production). Here's a practical example:\n\n**Scenario: Adjusting Logging Levels** \n\nWhen developing an application, it is often beneficial to have more verbose logging in debug mode to trace issues, while in production, excessive logging could affect performance and clutter log files. \n\n**Implementation**:\n1. Use a configuration parameter for logging settings in your bundle:\n   ```php\n   namespace App\\DependencyInjection;\n\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Config\\Definition\\Builder\\TreeBuilder;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Config\\Definition\\ConfigurationInterface;\n\n   class Configuration implements ConfigurationInterface\n   {\n       private bool $debug;\n\n       public function __construct(bool $debug)\n       {\n           $this->debug = $debug;\n       }\n\n       public function getConfigTreeBuilder(): TreeBuilder\n       {\n           $treeBuilder = new TreeBuilder('my_bundle');\n           $treeBuilder->getRootNode()\n               ->children()\n                   ->booleanNode('logging')->defaultValue($this->debug)->end()\n               ->end();\n\n           return $treeBuilder;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Load the configuration and define logging behavior based on the debug parameter:\n   ```php\n   namespace App\\DependencyInjection;\n\n   use Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\ContainerBuilder;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\DependencyInjection\\Extension;\n\n   class AppExtension extends Extension\n   {\n       public function getConfiguration(array $config, ContainerBuilder $container): Configuration\n       {\n           return new Configuration($container->getParameter('kernel.debug'));\n       }\n\n       public function load(array $configs, ContainerBuilder $container): void\n       {\n           $configuration = $this->getConfiguration($configs, $container);\n           $config = $this->processConfiguration($configuration, $configs);\n           \n           // Example: Set logging based on %kernel.debug%\n           if ($config['logging']) {\n               // Set verbose logging\n           } else {\n               // Set minimum logging\n           }\n\n           $container->loadFromExtension('my_bundle', $config);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\nIn this setup, the logging configuration is directly tied to the value of `%kernel.debug%`, allowing the application to dynamically switch between detailed and minimal logging based on the environment.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can defaults with `%kernel.debug%` be set in a Symfony Bundle?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Setting defaults with `%kernel.debug%` in a Symfony Bundle can be done during the configuration declaration phase within the configuration class. This allows you to dynamically assign default values based on the current debug state of the application. Here\u2019s how you can set this up:\n\n1. **Define Configuration Class**: Create your configuration class where you specify parameters and provide logic to assign default values using the debug parameter:\n   ```php\n   namespace App\\DependencyInjection;\n\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Config\\Definition\\Builder\\TreeBuilder;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Config\\Definition\\ConfigurationInterface;\n\n   class Configuration implements ConfigurationInterface\n   {\n       private bool $debug;\n\n       public function __construct(bool $debug)\n       {\n           $this->debug = $debug;\n       }\n\n       public function getConfigTreeBuilder(): TreeBuilder\n       {\n           $treeBuilder = new TreeBuilder('my_bundle');\n           $treeBuilder->getRootNode()\n               ->children()\n                   ->booleanNode('logging')->defaultValue($this->debug)->end()\n               ->end();\n\n           return $treeBuilder;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Use the Extension to Inject the Value**: Within your extension class, use the container to inject the debug parameter during the configuration loading process:\n   ```php\n   namespace App\\DependencyInjection;\n\n   use Symfony\\Component\\DependencyInjection\\ContainerBuilder;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\HttpKernel\\DependencyInjection\\Extension;\n\n   class AppExtension extends Extension\n   {\n       public function getConfiguration(array $config, ContainerBuilder $container): Configuration\n       {\n           return new Configuration($container->getParameter('kernel.debug'));\n       }\n\n       public function load(array $configs, ContainerBuilder $container): void\n       {\n           $configuration = $this->getConfiguration($configs, $container);\n           $config = $this->processConfiguration($configuration, $configs);\n           $container->loadFromExtension('my_bundle', $config);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the Configuration**: Now when the bundle is booted, the logging option will automatically default to the value of `%kernel.debug%`:\n   - If in debug mode, `logging` will be true.\n   - If not, `logging` will default to false.\n\nThis approach provides a flexible configuration mechanism that allows you to maintain different behaviors in various environments while keeping your code clean and manageable.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

It's prudent to ensure that production configurations do not reference this parameter directly to avoid unexpected behaviors.\n\n2. **Clarity and Documentation**: Direct usage of `%kernel.debug%` could potentially obfuscate the intended behavior of configurations, especially for new developers or contributors unfamiliar with the codebase. It may be more advantageous to explicitly define logging levels or behaviors rather than relying on inferred configurations.\n\n3. **Hard-Coded States**: If configurations solely depend on the debug state without any explicit condition handling, it can lead to tightly coupled code. In cases where behavior should be context-specific (based on other parameters or inputs), relying too heavily on `%kernel.debug%` might lead to less flexible design.\n\n4. **Testing Scenarios**: During testing, it might be necessary to simulate different conditions that do not directly relate to the debug state. Hardcoding configurations based on `%kernel.debug%` can hinder the ability to effectively replicate these conditions.\n\n5. **Configuration Mismanagement**: In larger applications, if multiple configuration values depend on `%kernel.debug%`, managing those configurations can get complex. Instead, using more explicit configuration structures tailored to specific environments may lead to more maintainable code.\n\nIn summary, while `%kernel.debug%` is a powerful tool for configuring Symfony applications, it should be used judiciously in larger, production-facing applications.
