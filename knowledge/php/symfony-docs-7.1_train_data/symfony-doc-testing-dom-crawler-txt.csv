"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the methods available for extracting information from nodes in a Crawler?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The Crawler offers several methods to extract information from its nodes:\n- **attr**: Retrieves the attribute value for the first node. For example, `\\$crawler->attr('class');`\n- **text**: Gets the text content for the first node. You can pass a default value in case the node does not exist (e.g., `\\$crawler->text('Default text content');`).\n- **text(null, true)**: This variant removes all extra white spaces from the text extracted.\n- **extract**: Returns an array of specified attributes for all nodes, such as `\\$crawler->extract(['_text', 'href']);`\n- **each**: Executes a lambda for each node and returns an array of results. For instance:\n```php\ndata = $crawler->each(function ($node, int $i): string {\n    return $node->attr('href');\n});\n```\nThese methods help to retrieve and manipulate node data effectively.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does the chaining of methods work in Crawler?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Chaining methods in the Crawler works by returning a new Crawler instance with each method call, allowing for fluid and expressive selections. This means you can progressively refine your set of nodes by applying multiple filters and actions sequentially.
