"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can routes be defined within Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In Symfony, routes can be defined using various formats including YAML, XML, PHP attributes, or traditional PHP files. The choice of format is flexible, as all provide the same features and levels of performance. Symfony recommends using PHP attributes for route definitions because they allow developers to place routing information close to the relevant controller code, enhancing maintainability. Here's an example of defining a route using PHP attributes:\n\n```php\n// src/Controller/BlogController.php\nnamespace App\\Controller;\n\nuse Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Controller\\AbstractController;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\HttpFoundation\\Response;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Routing\\Attribute\\Route;\n\nclass BlogController extends AbstractController\n{\n    #[Route('/blog', name: 'blog_list')]\n    public function list(): Response\n    {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
