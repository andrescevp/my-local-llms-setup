"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can a Form Type Extension affect multiple types at once?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""A Form Type Extension can affect multiple types at once by specifying a common parent type in the `getExtendedTypes()` method.

This means your extension's functionality will automatically apply to all those types without needing to create separate extensions for each one. Here's a quick example:\n```php\n// src/Form/Extension/TextTypeExtension.php\nnamespace App\\Form\\Extension;\n\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\AbstractTypeExtension;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Form\\Extension\\Core\\Type\\TextType;\n\nclass TextTypeExtension extends AbstractTypeExtension\n{\n    public static function getExtendedTypes(): iterable\n    {\n        return [TextType::class];\n    }\n}\n``` \nThis implementation would mean that any enhancements made in `TextTypeExtension` would be applied uniformly to all derived text input types.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
