For instance, mandatory fields such as username and password can be marked with a severity level of 'error', while an optional field like bank account number can be marked with a severity level of 'warning'.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How can customizing the error message template impact the frontend presentation of validation errors?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Customizing the error message template can significantly enhance the frontend presentation of validation errors.

ARIA roles can help inform assistive technologies about the nature of each error.\n4. **Interactive Feedback**: You could implement interactive error notifications that only expand or are shown when the corresponding input is in focus.
