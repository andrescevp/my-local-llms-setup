This feature is particularly useful when you want to reuse the same object for different purposes, like in a user registration and user update scenario, without having to redefine all the validation constraints. This fine-tuning helps in enhancing the user experience and ensuring that only relevant data is validated for the specific form.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
