"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does enabling HTTPS improve the security of a web application?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Enabling HTTPS improves the security of a web application by:\n1. **Encryption**: HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the client and server, preventing eavesdropping and ensuring that sensitive information (like login credentials, personal information, etc.) is not transmitted in plain text.\n2. **Data Integrity**: It helps ensure that data sent and received cannot be tampered with or altered during transmission, protecting against man-in-the-middle attacks.\n3. **Authentication**: HTTPS verifies that users are connected to the authentic server, reducing the risk of phishing attacks where users might be tricked into providing sensitive information to a malicious entity.\n4. **Browser Trust**: Modern browsers flag HTTP connections as 'Not Secure', which can affect user trust. Using HTTPS enhances user confidence in the safety of your site, potentially increasing user engagement and transaction rates.\nOverall, enabling HTTPS is essential for any web application that collects or manages sensitive data.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
