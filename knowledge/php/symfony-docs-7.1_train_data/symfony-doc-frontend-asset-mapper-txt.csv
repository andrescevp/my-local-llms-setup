If you're using Symfony Flex, this will automatically configure your project.

When you add your asset files (like images, CSS, or JavaScript files) in the `assets/` directory, they become publicly accessible and automatically versioned. \n\nFor example, if you have an image located at `assets/images/product.jpg`, you can reference it in a Twig template using:\n\n```twig\n{{ asset('images/product.jpg') }}\n```\n\nThis produces a URL like:\n```\n/assets/images/product-3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9.jpg\n```\nThe version hash (`3c16d9220694c0e56d8648f25e6035e9`) changes whenever the source file is updated, ensuring that users always get the latest version without browser cache issues.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
