This factory will allow Symfony to create your transport from a DSN.\n\n   Example:\n   ```php\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportFactoryInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\Serialization\\SerializerInterface;\n\n   class YourTransportFactory implements TransportFactoryInterface\n   {\n       public function createTransport(string $dsn, array $options, SerializerInterface $serializer): TransportInterface\n       {\n           return new YourTransport(/* ... */);\n       }\n\n       public function supports(string $dsn, array $options): bool\n       {\n           return 0 === strpos($dsn, 'my-transport://');\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Implement the Transport Interface**: Create a class that implements the `TransportInterface`, handling message sending and receiving.\n\n   Example:\n   ```php\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportInterface;\n   class YourTransport implements TransportInterface\n   {\n       public function send(Envelope $envelope): Envelope\n       {\n           // Logic to send the message\n       }\n\n       public function get(): iterable\n       {\n           // Logic to retrieve messages\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Register Your Transport Factory**: Register your transport factory as a service, typically in the `services.yaml` file.\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n       Your\\Transport\\YourTransportFactory:\n           tags: [messenger.transport_factory]\n   ```\n\n4. **Use Your Transport**: Finally, configure your transport in `messenger.yaml` with a custom DSN:\n   ```yaml\n   framework:\n       messenger:\n           transports:\n               yours: 'my-transport://...'\n   ```\n   This setup allows you to utilize your newly created transport in the Symfony Messenger component.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain how to implement a custom transport factory to interact with your transport in Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To implement a custom transport factory in Symfony, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Create the Transport Factory Class**: Create a class that implements `TransportFactoryInterface`. This interface requires you to define the `createTransport` and `supports` methods.\n\n   - The `createTransport` method is responsible for creating an instance of your transport based on the provided DSN and options.\n   - The `supports` method should check if the DSN format is applicable to your transport.\n\n   Example:\n   ```php\n   namespace Your\\Transport;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportFactoryInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\Serialization\\SerializerInterface;\n\n   class YourTransportFactory implements TransportFactoryInterface\n   {\n       public function createTransport(string $dsn, array $options, SerializerInterface $serializer): TransportInterface\n       {\n           return new YourTransport(/* Pass any necessary arguments */);\n       }\n\n       public function supports(string $dsn, array $options): bool\n       {\n           return str_starts_with($dsn, 'my-transport://'); // Check the DSN\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Define Your Transport Class**: Implement the transport class that adheres to the `TransportInterface`. This class will typically implement methods such as `send`, `get`, `ack`, and `reject` to manage message handling.\n\n   Example:\n   ```php\n   class YourTransport implements TransportInterface\n   {\n       public function send(Envelope $envelope): Envelope\n       {\n           // Logic to encode and store the message\n       }\n\n       public function get(): iterable\n       {\n           // Logic to fetch and decode messages\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Registering Your Factory**: Add your transport factory to the service container by tagging it under `messenger.transport_factory` in `services.yaml`:\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n       Your\\Transport\\YourTransportFactory:\n           tags: [messenger.transport_factory]\n   ```\n\n4. **Using Your Custom Transport**: In a configuration file such as `messenger.yaml`, you can now specify this transport using your DSN:\n   ```yaml\n   framework:\n       messenger:\n           transports:\n               yours: 'my-transport://your_config'\n   ```\n   This configuration allows you to utilize your custom transport throughout the Symfony application.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What are the key methods that need to be implemented in a custom Transport class?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In a custom Transport class in Symfony, you need to implement the following key methods defined in the `TransportInterface`:\n\n1. **send(Envelope $envelope): Envelope**: This method is responsible for sending a message. It takes an `Envelope` object as an argument, which contains the message to be sent and its metadata. You will typically serialize the message (using a serializer) and store it in your transport's backend (e.g., a database, queue, etc.).\n   \n   Example Implementation:\n   ```php\n   public function send(Envelope $envelope): Envelope\n   {\n       // Serialize the envelope to a format suitable for storage\n       $encodedMessage = $this->serializer->encode($envelope);\n       $uuid = Uuid::v4(); // generate unique identifier\n       // Store the encoded message in the database or messaging system\n       $this->db->createQuery('INSERT INTO my_queue (id, envelope) VALUES (:id, :envelope)')\n           ->setParameter('id', (string)$uuid)\n           ->setParameter('envelope', $encodedMessage['body'])\n           ->execute();\n       return $envelope->with(new TransportMessageIdStamp($uuid));\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **get(): iterable**: This method retrieves messages from the transport. It is expected to return an iterable of `Envelope` objects that are ready to be processed.  You should handle any logic for determining what constitutes a \""ready\"" message in this method.\n   \n   Example Implementation:\n   ```php\n   public function get(): iterable\n   {\n       $row = $this->db->createQuery('SELECT * FROM my_queue WHERE handled = FALSE')->getOneOrNullResult();\n       if (!$row) {\n           return [];\n       }\n       $envelope = $this->serializer->decode(['body' => $row['envelope']]);\n       return [$envelope->with(new TransportMessageIdStamp($row['id']))];\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **ack(Envelope $envelope): void**: This method acknowledges that a message has been successfully processed. This usually involves updating the message state in your storage to indicate that it has been handled.\n   \n   Example Implementation:\n   ```php\n   public function ack(Envelope $envelope): void\n   {\n       $stamp = $envelope->last(TransportMessageIdStamp::class);\n       if (!$stamp) {\n           throw new \\LogicException('No TransportMessageIdStamp found on the Envelope.');\n       }\n       $this->db->createQuery('UPDATE my_queue SET handled = TRUE WHERE id = :id')\n           ->setParameter('id', $stamp->getId())\n           ->execute();\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **reject(Envelope $envelope): void**: This method is used to remove a message from processing, indicating that there was an issue processing it. You would usually delete the corresponding record from your storage.\n   \n   Example Implementation:\n   ```php\n   public function reject(Envelope $envelope): void\n   {\n       $stamp = $envelope->last(TransportMessageIdStamp::class);\n       if (!$stamp) {\n           throw new \\LogicException('No TransportMessageIdStamp found on the Envelope.');\n       }\n       $this->db->createQuery('DELETE FROM my_queue WHERE id = :id')\n           ->setParameter('id', $stamp->getId())\n           ->execute();\n   }\n   ```\n   By implementing these methods, your custom transport will be able to properly send, receive, acknowledge, and reject messages.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train

Make sure each method adheres to the expected behavior defined by the interface.\n   \n   Example of implementing the methods:\n   ```php\n   class YourTransport implements TransportInterface\n   {\n       public function send(Envelope $envelope): Envelope\n       {\n           // Your implementation\n       }\n\n       public function get(): iterable\n       {\n           // Your implementation\n       }\n\n       public function ack(Envelope $envelope): void\n       {\n           // Your implementation\n       }\n\n       public function reject(Envelope $envelope): void\n       {\n           // Your implementation\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Transport Factory**: Implement a factory that creates instances of your transport class. This factory must implement `TransportFactoryInterface` and define methods to check for compatibility with your DSN and to create transport instances accordingly.\n   \n   Example:\n   ```php\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportFactoryInterface;\n   class YourTransportFactory implements TransportFactoryInterface\n   {\n       public function supports(string $dsn, array $options): bool\n       {\n           return str_starts_with($dsn, 'my-transport://');\n       }\n\n       public function createTransport(string $dsn, array $options, SerializerInterface $serializer): TransportInterface\n       {\n           return new YourTransport(/* pass necessary arguments */);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Register the Transport Factory as a Service**: Ensure your transport is registered in the Symfony service container with the proper tags to indicate that it is a transport factory. This allows Symfony to recognize it when configuring the Messenger component.\n   \n   Example in `services.yaml`:\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n       Your\\Transport\\YourTransportFactory:\n           tags: [messenger.transport_factory]\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure the Transport**: In your `messenger.yaml` (or respective config file), define your custom transport with a unique DSN. This links your transport to the Messenger system.\n   \n   Example configuration:\n   ```yaml\n   framework:\n       messenger:\n           transports:\n               yours: 'my-transport://...'\n   ```\n\n5. **Testing and Validation**: Finally, test your custom transport extensively to ensure all methods respond as expected, and validate that messages can be sent, received, acknowledged, and rejected correctly within the Symfony Messenger system.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you detail the registration process for a transport factory within Symfony?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The registration process for a transport factory within Symfony involves several steps to ensure that Symfony correctly recognizes and utilizes your custom transport. Here\u2019s a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Create Your Transport Factory**: First, implement a class that adheres to `TransportFactoryInterface`. This factory will handle the creation of your transport based on a specified DSN and options.\n\n   Example:\n   ```php\n   namespace Your\\Transport;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportFactoryInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\Serialization\\SerializerInterface;\n\n   class YourTransportFactory implements TransportFactoryInterface\n   {\n       public function createTransport(string $dsn, array $options, SerializerInterface $serializer): TransportInterface\n       {\n           return new YourTransport(/* ... parameters needed */);\n       }\n\n       public function supports(string $dsn, array $options): bool\n       {\n           return str_starts_with($dsn, 'my-transport://'); // This checks for your specific DSN pattern\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Register the Factory as a Service**: Open your `services.yaml` file and register your transport factory as a service. Use the `tags` option to tag the service with `messenger.transport_factory`. This tells Symfony's service container that this service is a transport factory.\n\n   Example:\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n       Your\\Transport\\YourTransportFactory:\n           tags: [messenger.transport_factory]\n   ```\n\n3. **Clear Cache (if necessary)**: After adding your service definition, you may need to clear the Symfony cache to ensure that the service container recognizes the new factory. Run the following command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   php bin/console cache:clear\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure in Messenger**: Next, configure your service as a transport within the Messenger configuration. Open or create `messenger.yaml` and define your DSN that corresponds to your custom transport.\n\n   Example:\n   ```yaml\n   framework:\n       messenger:\n           transports:\n               yours: 'my-transport://...'  # Here, 'yours' is a name you assign to your transport\n   ```\n\n5. **Use Your Transport**: Once registered and configured, your custom transport is now available for use.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the significance of the `supports` method in a custom Transport Factory?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The `supports` method in a custom Transport Factory is significant because it determines whether the factory can handle a given messaging DSN (Data Source Name). This method plays a critical role in the integration of custom transports into the Symfony Messenger component. Here\u2019s why it is important:\n\n1. **Identifying Compatibility**: The `supports` method checks the provided DSN against specific criteria defined by the factory. For instance, in a custom transport factory, this method verifies if the DSN starts with a specific prefix that identifies it as a valid type for your factory.\n   \n   Example Implementation:\n   ```php\n   public function supports(string $dsn, array $options): bool\n   {\n       return 0 === strpos($dsn, 'my-transport://'); // Confirm if DSN is valid for this transport\n   }\n   ```\n   This returns true if the DSN format matches, indicating to Symfony that this factory is responsible for that transport.\n\n2. **Enables Multiple Factories**: By implementing the `supports` method, you can have multiple transport factories within the same application, each responsible for different types of transports. Symfony will use this method to determine which factory to delegate the creation of a transport based on the DSN provided.\n\n3. **Prevents Errors**: By clearly defining which DSNs your factory supports, you minimize the chances of runtime errors when trying to create a transport from an unsupported DSN. If Symfony tries to use a factory that doesn't support the given DSN, it will simply skip it, avoiding potential issues.\n\n4. **Encouragement of Strong Cohesion**: The logical structure imposed by utilizing the `supports` method encourages strong cohesion within your code. Each transport factory can clearly define its role and what configurations it can accept, making it clear and maintainable.\n\nIn summary, the `supports` method is vital for the proper functioning of custom transports in Symfony, allowing the Messenger component to determine which factory to use based on the DSN, leading to a more structured and error-proof application.""}]",knowledge/php/symfony-docs-7.1,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you provide an example of how to configure a custom transport in Symfony's Messenger component?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Certainly! To configure a custom transport in Symfony's Messenger component, you need to follow a few steps to ensure your custom transport is correctly recognized and can interact with the Messenger's infrastructure. Below is a simple example illustrating how to set this up:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Transport Factory**: First, you need a transport factory that can understand your custom DSN. Here\u2019s an example implementation:\n   ```php\n   namespace Your\\Transport;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportFactoryInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\TransportInterface;\n   use Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Transport\\Serialization\\SerializerInterface;\n\n   class YourTransportFactory implements TransportFactoryInterface\n   {\n       public function createTransport(string $dsn, array $options, SerializerInterface $serializer): TransportInterface\n       {\n           return new YourTransport(/* ... additional arguments */);\n       }\n\n       public function supports(string $dsn, array $options): bool\n       {\n           return 0 === strpos($dsn, 'my-transport://');\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Register Your Factory as a Service**: Next, ensure your transport factory is registered in your `services.yaml`:\n   ```yaml\n   services:\n       Your\\Transport\\YourTransportFactory:\n           tags: [messenger.transport_factory]\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure the Transport in Messenger**: In your `messenger.yaml` (or another configuration file), specify your transport using the custom DSN.
