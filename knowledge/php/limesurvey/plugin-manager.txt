And some plugins are supported by others, outside the LimeSurvey team. If you would like to use them, check out the [https://www.limesurvey.org/index.php/community/extensions available plugins]. We hope you will also add your own plugin there!

==Auditlog==


The Auditlog plugin creates a log of '''administration''' events in a specific table called ''<DB prefix>auditlog_log''. 

For more details about the plugin and its options, check the following [[Audit_log|wiki section]].


==Export results to R==


If enabled, you will be able to export your survey results to R.


==LDAP== 


By activating this plugin, you can perform basic authentication against an LDAP server. Make sure your PHP configuration has LDAP support enabled.


'''Enabling and configuring settings for plugin AuthLDAP v2.05+''':
#Enable LDAP in PHP.INI.
#Verify that [http://php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php phpinfo.php] shows that LDAP is enabled.
#The location of LimeSurvey's built-in phpinfo.php is: Configuration -- Settings -- Global Settings -- Overview.  Then, below the table, you will have a link for "Show PHPInfo".
#Go to LimeSurvey Plugin Manager.
#Configure LDAP plugin.


{{Note|Read our [[LDAP configuration examples]] for further help.}}


==LimeSurvey internal database== 


This plugin is activated by default and cannot be disabled. It uses the built-in LimeSurvey database. It is a fall-back mechanism so that you can always login to the installation when needed. 


{{Note|For more details on authentication plugins, check the following [[Authentication_plugins|wiki section]].}}


==OldUrlCompat==


Old url (pre-2.0) compatible system.


==STATA export==


Activate it if you wish to export your survey results to a STATA .xml file.

Hit the ''Configure'' button to choose whether you want the .xml file be compatible with Stata 8 - State 12, or with State 13 or later.
 

==Webserver== 


This plugin leaves authentication to the webserver and reads the result from a configurable server setting. This method has been around for a while, and was configured from config.php. If you used this authentication, you should enable the plugin in the plugins menu and move your configuration from config.php to the plugin's settings.
