=Tips & Hints=


The following tips & hints were written by our community members. Feel free to add more:
* Authorized files extensions are defined [[Optional_settings#Upload_files|by settings in config.php files]].
* The pictures and media files that have been uploaded via the HTML editor are stored in the "upload/surveys/<sid>" subdirectory, where '''sid''' is the survey id.
* The uploaded files from survey X will only be seen while browsing the resources of survey X (groups, questions, answers). They cannot be seen from any other survey or objects (labels). However, do not expect this limited visibility to ensure confidentiality of the resources as they are reachable with a simple browser to anyone who knows the URL to the respective file.
* You can't import a ZIP file containing subdirectories.
