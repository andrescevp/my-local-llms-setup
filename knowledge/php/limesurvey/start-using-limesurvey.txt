**''Validation:'' This feature is available on all free text type or numeric questions. It is used for response validation. If the response is not validated, the user will be prompted to try again before they can progress.
**''Relevance Equation:'' This is a setting for advanced users. We recommend that the default value of "1" is used (it means that the item will always be shown).
**''Position:'' Choose where you want to position the question in the group.

Please note that, depending on the type of question selected, different tabs will be displayed below the '''General settings''' tab. To find out more about this, we suggest that you to first read [[Question types|the following wiki section]].

To add more questions, follow the same procedure described above.

==Add subquestions and answers==

Different types of questions may require subquestions, predefined sets of answers, both or neither. For example, a question that requires the age of a survey participant does not require a subquestion or predefined set of answers. On the other hand, a simple array question requires both subquestions and answers.

<div class="simplebox">[[File:help.png]] If subquestions and answers are missing from a question that requires either/both, this is highlighted in the question summary.</div>

The next screenshot contains an array-type question.


<center>[[File:QSG LS3 Subq q example.png]]</center>
