=General= <!--T:49-->

<!--T:50-->
A survey includes, via different interconnected databases: languages, questions, question groups, question attributes, sub-questions, answers, default answers, assessments, and quota settings. To facilitate the [[Surveys - introduction#Surveys|surveys management]], the [[Surveys - introduction#Survey groups|survey group]] functionality{{NewIn|3.0}} was recently added.

{{Box|You can also re-edit most of these settings by accessing the [[Survey settings|settings menu]] of the newly created survey and editing the desired options.}}
{{Alert|title=Attention|text=The HTML WYSIWYG editor does not allow you to upload files during the survey creation process. Doing so will cause an error message: E.g., "This file uploader is disabled". If you need to upload pictures or other resources, please do so after the survey creation by accessing the [[Resources|resources panel]] from the [[Survey settings|survey settings menu]].}}

===Text elements=== <!--T:60-->

<!--T:61-->
The following options are located under the Text Elements tab:

<!--T:62-->
*'''Survey Title:''' The title of the survey can be changed from this field.

<!--T:63-->
*'''Create example question and question group?:'''{{NewIn|3.0}} If enabled, an example question and question group will be added to your survey by default when you create a survey. This example question and question group will be displayed when the ''Save'' button is clicked to create the survey.
{{Alert|title=Attention|text=Please note that a question has to be first added to a question group in order to be displayed in a survey! Otherwise, the question will not be displayed to the survey participant.}}

<!--T:209-->
*'''Base Language''': This represents the main language of the survey. If you wish to add other survey languages, first create a survey, then access the [[General_settings#General_settings_panel|general settings]] of the newly created survey and add ''additional languages''. 

<!--T:64-->
*'''Description:''' You can type in a survey description. If enabled from the [[Global settings|global settings]], you can use the [[Global_settings#General|HTML editor]] to better customize the description field.

<!--T:65-->
*'''End URL:''' You have the possibility to redirect users to another page when they finish filling out the questionnaire. If you wish to redirect them, type in the URL and activate the '''automatically load URL''' option that is located under the [[Surveys - introduction#Presentation & navigation|Presentation & navigation tab]].

<!--T:66-->
*'''URL Description:''' A short end URL description can be added in instances where the user is redirected to a non-related survey webpage. It may help if the survey administrator adds notes relating to the usage of the respective URL.

<!--T:67-->
*'''Date Format:''' This option is important when you want to record [[Surveys - introduction#Notification & data management|timestamps]] together with the survey participants' answers. If you click on it, a drop-down list will show up with a several date formats. Choose the date format used in the geographical location of your respondents. Do not forget that different date formats are used across the world. For example, it is recommended that you use a different time format if your questionnaire focuses on the US market (mm-dd-yyyy) and not on the British market (dd-mm-yy).

<!--T:68-->
*'''Decimal Mark:''' Two options are available: dot (.) and comma (,). Choose the one that fits the place (the geographical location) where you conduct your study (e.g. US vs Germany).

<!--T:69-->
*'''Welcome Message:''' Type in a message that will welcome the survey participants when they access your survey link.

<!--T:70-->
*'''End Message:''' Type in a message that will be displayed to the survey participants once they finish the questionnaire. If the '''end URL''' field is [[Surveys - introduction#Presentation & navigation|automatically loaded]], the end message is no longer displayed.

<!--T:77-->
{{Note|'''Administrator''' and '''admin email''' are managed in the LimeSurvey [[Email templates|email templates]] system.}}
<div class="simplebox">[[File:help.png]]Many hosting providers' SMTP servers will only accept emails whose "From" address is on a local domain. All emails that do not conform to this rule are discarded silently, without any visible error message. If this happens, ensure that you are using a provider-based email address in the "Admin Email" field. You could also set up email forwarding on the provider's side, so that any messages sent there are forwarded to your preferred address.</div>

<!--T:78-->
*'''Bounce email:''' This is the email address where the delivery error notification emails (bounced emails) will be sent to.
<div class="simplebox">[[File:help.png]] A bounce email is an electronic email which is returned to the sender for various reasons (e.g. invalid address, temporary unavailable mail server, the recipient's mailbox is full, etc).</div>

<!--T:79-->
*'''Fax To:''' This field is used to print a fax number on the "printable survey" - i.e.: when you want to send someone a hard copy because he or she cannot use the online survey.

<!--T:80-->
*'''Group'''{{NewIn|3.0}}''':''' Select the [[Surveys - introduction#Survey groups|survey group]] that the newly created survey should be added to. 

<!--T:81-->
*'''Format:''' This function allows you to choose the way in which the questions will be displayed to the survey respondents. Three options are available: 
**''Question by Question'' : The questions will be displayed one by one (one question per page). If this option is chosen, a separate "welcome" page and "end" page will be displayed when taking the survey.
**''Group by Group'' : Each survey page will display a question group. Also, a separate "welcome" page and "end" page will be displayed when taking the survey, as with the "Question by Question" surveys.
**''All In One'' : If chosen, all the pages will be displayed on a single page. If you select this option, no separate pages will be displayed for the "welcome" and "end" pages - they will all appear on the same page, together with the questions.

<!--T:82-->
*'''Template:''' The default template is rather simple, but functional. More information on creating your own templates is available [[Theme  editor|here]].

===Presentation & navigation=== <!--T:83-->
The following options can be found under the Presentation & Navigation tab:


<!--T:84-->
<center>[[File:Create a new survey - Presentation & navigation.png]]</center>


<!--T:85-->
*'''Navigation Delay (Seconds):''' This feature displays the number of seconds before the previous, next, and submit buttons are enabled. If none is specified, the option will use the default value, which is "0" (seconds).

<!--T:86-->
*'''Show Question Index / Allow Jumping:''' A question index can be displayed in the survey if this function is enabled, allowing the user to jump from one question group to another. You can choose the following:
**''Disabled'' : If this option is selected, no index is shown in the survey.
**''Incremental'' : If this option is selected, the question groups will be shown incrementally in an index menu located on the survey page. You are allowed to "jump back" only to the question groups that were previously visited/accessed.
**''Full'' : Jumping from question group to question group is allowed via the index menu.

<!--T:87-->
*'''Show "There Are X Questions In This Survey"''': This shows the total number of questions in your survey.

<!--T:88-->
*'''Show Group Name and/or Group Description:''' This function allows you to choose whether your survey will show participants the question group name only, the group description only or both. You may also choose to hide both. 

<!--T:89-->
*'''Show Question Number and/or Code:''' This function allows you to choose whether your survey will show participants the question number only, the question code only or both.  You may also choose to hide both.  Please note, the question number is shown the moment someone starts the survey, while the question code is shown next to each survey question.

<!--T:90-->
*'''Show "No Answer":''' When a ''"radio button"'' or ''"select type"'' question that contains editable answers (e.g.: List & Array questions) has the '''Show "No Answer"''' option enabled and it is also '''not mandatory''', an additional entry "No Answer" is displayed for each question/sub-question. In this way, the respondents may choose not to answer the respective question/sub-question. The following two options are available for survey administrators:

<!--T:91-->
**''On'' : If this option is selected, the respondents can choose the "No Answer" option for a non-mandatory question.
**''Off'' : If selected, the "No Answer" option will not be displayed as a possible answer for any non-mandatory question.

<!--T:92-->
{{Box|Options set in the [[Global settings#Presentation|global settings]] override all other survey settings.  Therefore, if the super-administrator chooses to have the "No Answer" option displayed, then the '''Show "No Answer"''' of the local survey field becomes non-selectable.  The same applies to the ''"Off"'' option. To offer freedom to survey administrators, the super-administrator has to choose "Selectable" for the '''Show "No Answer"''' option from the global settings of your LimeSurvey installation.}}

<!--T:93-->
*'''Show Welcome Screen:''' If turned off, the welcome text message will not be displayed at the beginning of the questionnaire.

<!--T:94-->
*'''Allow Backward Navigation:''' If enabled, this will allow the users to navigate backwards and change his or her previous answers. 

<!--T:95-->
*'''Show On-Screen Keyboard:''' If turned on, an on-screen keyboard will will be displayed when answering questions that require typing in information. 

<!--T:96-->
*'''Show Progress Bar:''' When enabled, this function displays a progress bar that shows participants how much of the survey they have completed and how much is left to be completed.

<!--T:97-->
*'''Participants May Print Answers:''' If turned on, the survey participants may choose at the end of the survey to print their answers. 

<!--T:98-->
*'''Public Statistics:''' A link to a set of statistics will be shown at the end of the survey if this option is enabled.

<!--T:99-->
*'''Show Graphs In Public Statistics:''' If enabled, graphs will also be shown in the Public Statistics at the end of the survey. Please note that the "Public Statistics" option has to be enabled to allow the survey participants to see the graphs.

<!--T:100-->
*'''Automatically Load URL When Survey Complete:''' The end URL becomes a redirect link once the survey is completed if this option is turned on.

===Publication & access control=== <!--T:101-->

<!--T:102-->
The following options can be found under the Publication & Access Control tab:


<!--T:103-->
<center>[[File:Publication & access control.png]]</center>


<!--T:104-->
*'''Start Date/Time:''' This is the date/time the survey starts.

<!--T:105-->
*'''Expiry Date/Time:''' This function allows you to choose a date for your survey to expire.  This is the last date on which the public survey script will let people participate. (Example: If you set the expiry date for the 31st of December, then people will no longer be able to fill out the survey on the 1st of January). To remove an expiry date, just clear the date from the input field.

<!--T:106-->
*'''List Survey Publicly:''' The default value is "No". When it is set to "Yes", your survey will be listed in the "Available Surveys" portal where it can be seen by all [[Manage users|LimeSurvey users]].

<!--T:107-->

<!--T:108-->
*'''Use CAPTCHA for Survey Access:''' In order to access the survey, a CAPTCHA code has be typed in by the survey participant.

<!--T:109-->
*'''Use CAPTCHA for Registration:''' In order to register for the survey, a CAPTCHA code has be typed in by the survey participant.

<!--T:110-->
*'''Use CAPTCHA for Save and Load:''' Enable this function if you want a survey participant to type in a CAPTCHA code when he or she loads the survey again after only a part of it was completed (to prevents automated responses).

===Notification & data management=== <!--T:111-->

<!--T:112-->
The following options can be found under the Notification & Data Management tab:


<!--T:113-->
<center>[[File:Create a new survey - Notification & data management.png]]</center>


<!--T:114-->
*'''Date Stamp:''' Enable this functionality if you would like to see the time when the answers were submitted. 

<!--T:115-->
*'''Save IP Address:''' If "yes" is selected, the IP address of the survey respondent will be stored together with his or her answers. 

<!--T:116-->
*'''Save Referrer URL:''' If "yes" is selected, the referrer URL will be stored together with the answers.

<!--T:117-->
*'''Save Timings:''' If this functionality is enabled, the time spent on each page of the survey by each participant is recorded. 

<!--T:118-->
*'''Enable Assessment Mode:''' You can enable/disable assessments for this survey with this setting.

<!--T:119-->
*'''Participant May Save and Resume Later:''' This setting allows a participant to save his/her responses and resume the survey at a later time. Please note that this is most useful with open surveys or surveys in which the participants are anonymous. If you are using [[Survey participants|tokens]] and the survey [[Participant settings|is not anonymous]], in most cases it is better to activate '''token-based response persistence''' from the [[Participant settings]] panel.

<!--T:120-->
*'''Send Basic Admin Notification Email To''' and '''Send Detailed Admin Notification Email To''': These two functions allow you to send notifications or survey responses to any email address once the survey is submitted. You can edit the templates for these emails from the [[Survey settings#Email templates|Email templates menu]]. You can choose the option to send emails to multiple recipients simultaneously by separating the email address entries with a semicolon (;) (e.g "yourname@test.com; myname@test.com; hisname@test.com" or (if using placeholders) "yourname@test.com;{INSERTANS:82733X12X73};{TOKEN:EMAIL}"). 

<!--T:121-->
{{Box|To send an email to the survey administrator, '''you must use {ADMINEMAIL}'''. 

<!--T:122-->
There are different ways for entering an email address:
#Enter a specific email address (ie: yourname@test.com).
#Enter a SGQA code and the response will be sent to an email address entered as an answer to that particular question (use the format {INSERTANS:9999X88X12} in the same way you would reuse information from previous answers).
#'''The following is only possible if your survey is not anonymous'''.  Enter a token code and the response will be sent to an email address retrieved from a token field.  Use the format {TOKEN:EMAIL} or {TOKEN:ATTRIBUTE_1} in the same way you would re-use Information from the '''Survey participants''' table.}}

<!--T:123-->
*'''Google Analytics Settings:''' If you would like to get details about the survey web traffic, use Google Analytics. Three options are available:
**''None'' : Google Analytics will not be used.
**''Use Settings Below'' : If this option is chosen, the survey owner can type in his or her Google Analytics Tracking ID to be stored only with the respective survey. You also have the ability to choose one of the three Google Analytics styles.
***Do Not Use Google Analytics - so {GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JAVASCRIPT} is an empty string.
***Default Google Analytics - {GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JAVASCRIPT} uses the standard Google Analytics code, inserting the proper Google Analytics Key.
***SurveyName-[SID]/GroupName - {GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JAVASCRIPT} contains customized Google Analytics code to log the URL as {SURVEYNAME}-[{SID}]/{GROUPNAME}. This can be helpful if you want to analyze navigation paths through your survey, time spent per page, and drop-off rates per page.
**''Use Global Settings'' : If this option is chosen, the survey will use the same Google Analytics Tracking ID as the one saved in the [[Global settings#General|global settings]] and then you choose the desired Google Analytics style. 

<!--T:124-->
{{Box|Google Analytics Tracking ID for a specific survey allows for integration with Google Analytics. The tracking ID can be inserted into templates using {GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_KEY}. The full JavaScript that Google Analytics expects (including the key) can be included in templates via {GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_JAVASCRIPT}.}}
{{Note|For further details on how to use Google's API with LimeSurvey, check our [[Google API howto|Google API howto page]].}}

===Participant settings=== <!--T:125-->

<!--T:126-->
The following options can be found under the Participant Settings tab:


<!--T:127-->
<center>[[File:Create a new survey - participant settings.png]]</center>


<!--T:128-->
*'''Set Token Length To:''' Usually, the default value of 15 digits does not need to be changed (the maximum supported value is 35).  However, if you wish to change this setting, please enter a number (X) which is greater than 5. If the number entered is less than 5, it will be converted to the default value of 15. '''When generating tokens, all tokens will use a length of X digits'''.

<!--T:129-->
*'''Anonymized Responses:''' This functionality allows you to determine whether responses to your survey are matched with information from the '''Survey Participants''' table (utilized in the respective survey) or are kept "anonymous". The default is "No". If you choose "Yes", then your survey is set to anonymize responses - '''there will be no way to connect answers and participants'''. Even the survey administrator will not be able to link response data and participant/token data. However, you will always be able to specifically view each response entered by your participants in the survey. Thus individual and anonymous analyses can still be done. 

<!--T:130-->
{{Alert|title=Attention|text=If this feature is activated, the response submission date and the token completed date are always set to 1980-01-01 00:00, regardless of other settings. Invalidating the submission date ensures no match with the web server logs where the token key might show up when a survey is started. Invalidating the token completed date guarantees that you cannot align the order of submitted responses to the order of the token date/time.}}

<!--T:131-->
*'''Enable Token-Based Response Persistence:''' If your survey uses tokens and your responses are not anonymized, you may want to enable this feature. If you enable this feature, your participants will be able to leave the survey and resume later at any time without using the '''Resume Later''' function - for example, when they get distracted or their browser crashes. Upon clicking the invitation link again, they will be returned to the point in the survey where they left off with previous entries saved.

<!--T:132-->
*'''Allow Multiple Responses or Update Responses With One Token:''' If this option is activated, participants will be able to return to their survey by clicking the invitation link, even if they have already submitted the survey. If the survey is anonymous or "Enable Token-Based Response Persistence" is set to "No", this will add a new response. If the survey is not anonymous and "Enable Token-Based Response Persistence" is enabled, the user will update the existing responses.

<!--T:133-->
*'''Allow Public Registration:''' If you use tokens to control access to your survey, the only people who can use the survey are those who have an entry and a unique token code allocated in the [[Survey participants|Survey participants table]]. If you would like to use tokens, but also allow public registration, set this to "Yes". The "Yes" setting will allow visitors to register his or her name and email address. The script will create a new entry in your '''Survey Participants''' table for this person, then send them an invitation email. The script will ensure that only one person per email address can complete your survey.

<!--T:134-->
*'''Use HTML Format For Token Emails:''' When enabled, all emails sent by the token management interface (invite, reminder, confirmation) will be formatted as HTML. You will then be able to use rich formatting for these emails. The default value is "Yes". 
{{Alert|title=Attention|text=When you switch this feature on or off, you will have to double check that your email templates are still displayed as you want.}}

<!--T:135-->
*'''Send Confirmation Emails:''' If enabled, the participant will receive a confirmation email that the survey was submitted.

==Import a survey== <!--T:136-->

The import function "intelligently" re-numbers the survey, groups, questions, answers, and condition IDs so that they all match each other. No existing survey is going to be overwritten during the import process.

<!--T:141-->
By default, the resource links and expression fields are also imported. Basically, the more advanced type of questions are going to be also imported along questions that include complex branching, assessments, validation, and tailoring. 

<!--T:142-->
{{Note|For further details on LimeSurvey expression manager, read [[ExpressionScript - Presentation|our wiki]].}}

<!--T:143-->
Once the import process is completed, a survey structure import summary will be displayed, showing whether it was successful or not:
