=Responses summary =


The following section of LimeSurvey focuses on responses and statistics creation. Once accessed, the [[Responses & statistics#Responses summary|summary page]] is displayed by default:


<center>[[File:response summary - info.png]]</center>


The first table is called "''Response summary''" and displays the following:

*'''Full responses''' - the number of surveys submitted by your respondents (by clicking the "Submit" button located on the last page of your survey

*'''Incomplete responses''' - the number of surveys that have not been completely filled out by your respondents


{{Note|In the [[Responses]] table, the incomplete answers are response records with no submission date. Such a record can occur when a participant uses the ''resume later'' function, or when an operator uses the data entry functionality to fill out a survey without submitting the answer, or when a participant fails to complete the survey because he/she just left.}}


*'''Total responses''' - the aggregated number of complete/full and incomplete responses


If you make use of the [[Survey participants|survey participants option]], then a summary of the survey participants-related data is displayed on this page below the "Response summary" table:
