===Interface language===


You can select the administrative language preference during log in by using the dropdown list as shown below. After a successful login, the LimeSurvey interface will change to the chosen language. The system will record this preference setting in your profile and make it the default for your next login.


<center>[[File:login language.png]]</center>


<!--T15-->Some LimeSurvey setups hide or skip the login page to enable common authentication inside other applications. In this case, you won't have access to select the language. However, you can change your language preference from your account preferences. Access your account preferences by clicking your user name located in the upper right side of your browser and then the ''Your account'' button. Next, click the '''Your personal settings''' tab and select your desired language from the dropdown list located under '''Interface language'''.

===HTML editor mode===

There is an '''HTML editor''' integrated into LimeSurvey. This tool will help you develop rich formatting for your surveys, groups, questions, and answer text; for tables, and images.  But as this editor takes extra space on the screen and resources on the computer, it is not always desirable to use. Therefore, four options are provided by LimeSurvey: '''default''', '''inline HTML editor''' (selected by default), '''popup HTML editor''', and '''no HTML editor'''.

====Default====

If the "default" option is selected, you will inherit the HTML editor mode selected by the superadminstrator from the [[Global settings#General|global settings]] of the LimeSurvey installation.

====Inline====
In this case, the '''HTML editor''' is always used in-line on the page. It also represents the 'default' value.


<center>[[File:InlineMode1.PNG]]</center>


====Popup====
The normal text editor is used, but the '''HTML editor''' is available as a pop-up option. You can always get to the '''HTML editor''' by clicking on the icon on the right of the normal text editor window as shown for the '''popup''' option below


<center>[[File:Popup1.PNG]]</center>


=====Fullscreen{{ObsoleteIn|3.0}}=====

This option is available only for inline editor. It allows you to increase the size of the editor to fill the browser window and then decrease it back later.{{ObsoleteIn|3.0}}


<center>[[File:InlineMode2.PNG]]</center>


When switching between which editor you use, the last used editor before logout is recorded in your profile and will become the default at your next login.

Please note that when editing answers and labels, the normal text editor (or 'Popup' mode) is always used because of the larger number of windows.

{{Note|You can change the size of the HTML editor box by clicking on the bottom right corner of the editor.}}


<center>[[File:ExtendsizeHTML.png]]</center>


====Source code mode====

If you want to paste HTML or Javascript code directly, you must switch to the '''source code''' mode. This option is not available in your personal settings. However, it can be selected from the HTML editor menu.


<center>[[File:source_code_mode.png]]</center>


You must [[Global settings#Security|disable the ''Filter HTML for XSS'' setting]] in order to store code entered in the source code mode (or to have superadmin permissions).


<center>[[File:SourceCodeMode.png]]</center>


====No HTML editor====
If you do not want to use an HTML editor, select this option. You will be able to use only simple text in the surveys. 

<div class="simplebox">'''Hint''': Why not always choose the '''HTML Editor'''? Depending on your use of LimeSurvey, there may be many text boxes on a single page, each with a copy of the editor. For instance, when editing the email text for a survey invitation that is offered in 5 languages, you can then have a total of 20 inline '''HTML editors''' active on the page. Each instance takes a fair amount of resources and will likely cause issues on your browser. So, if you work with multiple language surveys, we recommend you stick with the normal text editor or 'Popup' setting.</div>

===Question type selector===

Choose 'Full selector' to get a question type selector with preview and 'Simple selector' to get a plain select box. The 'default' option corresponds to the option selected in the [[Global settings|global settings]] of the LimeSurvey installation.

===Template editor mode===

Three options are available: 'default', 'full template editor', and 'simple template editor'. Choose 'Full template editor' to get an enhanced editor (with syntax-highlighting) when editing survey templates and 'Simple template editor' to get a plain editor field. The 'default' option corresponds to the option selected in the [[Global settings|global settings]] of the LimeSurvey installation.

{{Note|For a more comprehensive presentation of our template editor, check the [[The template editor|following wiki]].}}

===Date format===

This setting sets the date format for your profile (e.g. when you browse the survey results or for other settings located in the administration panel). It does '''not''' affect the actual surveys.

When creating a date/time question, you can set the date/time format when you edit/add a question. After you have chosen the '''date/time''' question format, type in the desired format you would like to use in the boxes located under the Input and Display tabs. For extra information, hover the mouse over the heading of each box.
