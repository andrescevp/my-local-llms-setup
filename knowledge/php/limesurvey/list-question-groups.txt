=Question Groups In This Survey=


The search box at the top of the question groups table allows you to search for a group by name.


The table columns are:

*'''Group ID:''' The ID of the question group.

*'''Group order:''' The order of the question groups.

*'''Group name:''' The name of the group.

*'''Description:''' The question group description.


{{Note|'''Note:''' For more details on question groups, refer to the following [[Question groups - introduction|wiki subsection]].}}


*'''Quick-action buttons:''' Four quick-action buttons are displayed:
**''Add new question to group:'' Allows you to add a new question to the desired group.
**''Edit group:'' Allows you to edit the question group. 
**''Group summary:'' Redirects you to the summary page of the respective group. The summary includes the title and description of the question group. If enabled (the fields are not empty), [[Question_groups_-_introduction#Create_question_group|the randomization group and relevance equation attributes]] will also be listed.
**''Delete group:'' Deletes a group. If clicked, a confirmation pop-up message will be displayed on the screen.


From the bottom-right side of the table, you can select the number of rows (entries) you wish to be displayed per page. 


{{Note| In comparison to the [[list questions|list questions panel]], no group-edit buttons are available since survey administrators could accidentally delete not only multiple question groups, but also their corresponding questions, answers, and subquestions they belong to.
