*'''Menu icon''': All the used icons are fontawesome icons by default. To find other available icons, check the following [https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_text.asp link]. Introduce in the box the string located after "fa fa-". E.g., for a floppy disk, we have "fa fa-floppy-o". To use it as an icon for a menu entry, type in this box only "floppy-o".

==Edit menu entry==

To change the details of an already existing menu entry, click the green button located in the '''Action''' column. The respective menu will get selected and you can do the edits.

==Delete menu entry==
 
To delete a menu entry, click the red trash button that corresponds to that respective menu entry (located in the '''Action''' column).

==Reorder menu entries==

The ordering process takes first into account the '''menu''' an entry belongs to, and then it orders the entries according to the value from the '''order field'''. Once you change these values, click the '''reorder''' button to get the entries rearranged in the table.
