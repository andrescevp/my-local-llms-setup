== Introduction ==
When doing automated installs (e.g. in a virtual machine setup), we can use LimeSurvey's (v2.x referred to here) CLI (command-line interface) to good effect. The files used for this purpose (and for resetting passwords as well) are in the '''WEBROOT/application/commands''' folder, the one of interest here being '''console.php'''.

== Pre-requisites ==
* PHP CLI should be available
* '''WEBROOT/application/config/config.php''' should be available and populated with the parameters provided by the automated installation process.
* The availablity of the PHP Modules permissions should match the needs of '''LimeSurvey'''.
* An empty MySQL database should be created and the user should have the proper privileges in order to use it.

== Usage ==
For illustration purposes, we assume in our example the '''WEBROOT''' to be '''/var/www/limesurvey'''.

<source lang="bash">
cd /var/www/limesurvey/application/commands
php console.php
</source>
This will show:
<pre>
Yii command runner (based on Yii v1.1.14)
Usage: console.php <command-name> [parameters...]

The following commands are available:
 - install
 - message
 - migrate
 - plugin
 - resetpassword
 - shell
 - webapp

To see the individual command help, use the following:
   console.php help <command-name>
</pre>

== Syntax ==
<pre>
php console.php <Admin User Name> <Admin User Password> <Full Name> <EMail ID>
</pre>

* The Full Name and Password are enclosed in double quotes if they contain spaces or other special characters.
* All the other parameters like DB Name, DB Type, DB User, DB Password etc. are to be populated in the '''config.php''' file before script execution.
* The script should be executed from and in the '''WEBROOT/application/commands''' folder only.

== Example ==
<source lang="bash">
cd /var/www/limesurvey/application/commands
php console.php install limeadmin pwd123 Admin admin@mydomain.com
</source>

outputs the following text:
<pre>
/var/www/limesurvey/installer/sql/create-mysql.sql
</pre>
and the database should be properly installed at the moment.
