{{Hint|Text=Unlike all other question types, if an equation is hidden, it is still computed, its value being stored in the database.}}

{{Hint|Text=Equation question type allow to assign a value to another Question. See how to [[ExpressionScript - Presentation#Using assignment operator|use assignment Operator]].}}

{{Alert|No HTML tag can be saved in the database due to security concerns.}}

This question type lets the author create an equation (e.g., a calculation or tailored report) and save it in a database variable. Equations can use any syntax supported by [[ExpressionScript - Presentation|ExpressionScript]]. If you are handling numeric values make sure that you use the advanced question setting "Numbers only" as explained below.

You may find below an example on how to use this question type:

=Editing an equation=

== Using dedicated setting==

The best way to edit equation is to use dedicated setting : this allow using same equation for different languages, and to be sure than no HTML is integrated in equation. This allow you to show a complete sentence to user but save only the needed value in database : for example put {weightkg/tall} in equation setting and show “Your BMI is {self.NAOK}”.

If you need Expression inside : you have to add the curly brace.

== Using Question text==

You can do edits via the HTML/WYSIWYG editor or from the HTML source:

* Using the WYSIWYG editor:


<center>[[File:Equation-01.png]]</center>


*From the HTML source:


<center>[[File:Equation-02.png]]</center>


The edits in the source code are recommended when you wish to record in your response table a clean text or a clean numeric value. By editing the source, you can remove/delete any HTML code that can affect the storing process.
