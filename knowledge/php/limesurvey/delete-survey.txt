*We highly recommend our users to export the survey and its corresponding responses table before deleting it.</br>
*The responses table is getting archived and it can still be recovered for a limited period of time. However, for the sake of simplicity and to avoid further import-related complications, we recommend our users to also backup the responses table.}}
