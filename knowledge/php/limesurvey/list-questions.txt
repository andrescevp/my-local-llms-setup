=Questions Table=


The screenshot above shows (on the top-right side of the table) a search box that allows you to look for a specific question. The group filter can be applied in the case you use similar question names across multiple question groups.

The table columns are:

*'''Question ID:''' Displays a numeric value representing the ID of the question.

*'''Question order:''' Lists the order in which the questions are displayed to the participants.

*'''(Question) Code:''' The question code is mainly used with [[ExpressionScript - Presentation|expressions]].

*'''Question:''' The question text is displayed under this column.

*'''Question type:''' Displays the question type. For further details on the available LimeSurvey question types, check the following [[Question types|link]].

*'''Group:''' Shows the group a question belongs to. For more details on question groups, click [[Question groups - introduction|here]].

*'''Mandatory:''': To find out more about what it means for a question to be mandatory, click [[QS:Mandatory|here]]. Three options can be displayed in the table:
**''Not specified:'' The question is not mandatory.
**''Specified:'' The question has to be filled in by respondents.
**''Not relevant:'' The attribute ''Mandatory'' cannot be edited (e.g., [[Question type - Text display|text display questions]]). 

*'''Other:''' It refers to attribute [[QS:Other|Other]]. If enabled, another answer option will be displayed alongside the ones defined by you. Three options can be displayed in the table:
**''Not specified:'' The question does not have the attribute ''Other'' enabled (no "other" answer option will be displayed alongside your defined answers).
**''Specified:'' If specified, option ''Other'' is active. This means that an ''other'' answer option will be displayed alongside your defined question answers. 
**''Not relevant:'' Certain questions do not allow you to enable the ''Other'' option (such as text display or free text question types). 


{{Note| '''Note:''' For a quick introduction on questions, check the following [[Questions - introduction|wiki subsection]].}}


*'''Quick-action buttons:''' The last column contains four quick action buttons:
**''Question preview:''  Allows you to preview a question.
**''Edit question:'' To edit the question text or other question-related attributes, click the green pencil.
**''Question summary:'' Provides access to the most important details of the respective question, such as the question text and the enabled attributes.
**''Delete:'' The red trash button - once clicked, you mustconfirm the question deletion, as well as the deletion of its contents (answer options and subquestions).

==Group-Editing Questions==


The '''Selected question(s)...''' button is located on the bottom-left side of the table.  As the name suggests, it allows survey administrators to perform certain group-actions. They are divided in general and advanced options:

* '''Set ''Other'' state:''' To enable or disable attribute [[QS:Other|Other]] for multiple questions at once, use this button.
* '''Present subquestions/answer options in random order:''' If enabled, the subquestions and question answers will be displayed to each survey participant in a random order. For more details on this attribute, continue reading [[QS:Random_order|here]].


{{Hint|Text=From the bottom-right corner of the table you can select the number of rows/entries to be displayed per page. The default number is 10. However, if you wish to perform certain group-editing actions via the '''Selected question(s)''' button, increase the number.}}
