{{Alert|title=Attention|text=The following wiki section covers how to install and activate a plugin. '''Note''' that third-party plugins may not be safe to run! '''They may break your installation'''! Please, proceed carefully! In the case in which you do need to use a plugin but you do not know whether you should run it or not, contact your LimeSurvey instance provider!}}


{{Note|For advanced information on the plugin system, check our [[Plugins - advanced|wiki section]] for advanced users.}}

In the above screenshot, the "AuditLog" plugin is active and asks the survey administrator whether the survey logs should be audited or not.


{{Alert|title=Attention|text=Please note that certain providers limit the access to third-party plugins. For example, LimeSurvey GmbH provides Professional packages (quick access to LimeSurvey instances) without providing the necessary permissions to its users to install third-party plugins because of security concerns - e.g., the installation of an unsupported plugin may break down your LimeSurvey instance.}}
