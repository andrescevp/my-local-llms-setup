=Introduction=

This page offers you a visual overview of all available question types. You can also see it as a starting point from where you can get to different wiki sections that explain in detail every question type.

<div class="simplebox">[[File:help.png]] The LimeSurvey download package includes a sample survey which includes all question types. You'll find it in your "/docs/demosurveys/" directory. Import each of them and try every question type!</div>

Please note that a LimeSurvey survey consists of question groups which contain one or more question. Therefore, you must '''create a question group first''' before you add questions to your survey. For more details on question groups, read the following [[Question groups - introduction|wiki section]].

=Question types=

To change the question type, you must first open the question in ''edit mode'' and click the '''General options''' tab located in the panel on the right side of the page:


<center>[[File:Question_type_button_location.png]]</center>


Then, select the desired question type from the ''Select question type'' menu.  To help ensure that you choose the correct question type, a preview of the question type is displayed in the ''Select question type'' panel.

===Subquestions===

Usually a question only has answers. But there are certain question types (like the Array question type) which are basically a subset of questions where each subquestion can be answered by the survey participant (often by using a predefined scale of answer options).

[[File:F_AFL.png]]

A more complex example is the question type 'Array of texts' where the respondent has to enter values for combinations. In that case the value entered by the respondent is the 'answer' and the two scales on the array are two scales of subquestions.

==Arrays==

The ''Array question type'' further extends the ''List question type''. Using this question type, a matrix can be displayed where the left column is represented by a subquestion, while each row is represented by the same set of answer options. The text of the question can be either a specific question or a description.

In terms of output there is no difference in how responses are stored compared to ''List (Radio)'' question type. The given answer is stored in a separate column in the result table for both question types.

The most flexible array types are ''Array'', ''Array (Text)'' and ''Array (Numbers)'. However, LimeSurvey also supports a number of array types which have predefined answer options (e.g., ''Array 5 point choice'').
