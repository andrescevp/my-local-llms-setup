'''Note: LimeSurvey PRO is now LimeSurvey Cloud.'''


Before starting the discussion about '''LimeSurvey Cloud''' and '''LimeSurvey CE''' (LimeSurvey Community Edition), it is important to understand the difference between ''LimeSurvey'' and ''LimeSurvey GmbH''.

''LimeSurvey'' refers to the web server-based software that is freely distributed under the [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html GNU General Public License v2] (GPL v2) and above.

''LimeSurvey GmbH'' refers to the company that was built around the LimeSurvey software in order to better coordinate its development and provide various LimeSurvey paid services (e.g., hosting, personalized templates, add-on packages, technical support, etc.).

Because LimeSurvey has a General Public License and is an <u>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software Open-source software]</u>, it can be used, modified, and distributed for commercial, private, and educational purposes by anyone, '''with the exception of the name and logo, which are trademarked'''.  For example, LimeSurvey can easily be used to create and distribute questionnaires for the evaluation of university classes or professors, or it can be installed on a private server for the purpose of conducting online/offline market research for your business.

<div class="simplebox">[[File:help.png]] LimeSurvey is an Open-source software. The code of the program is fully disclosed. You can access it at https://github.com/LimeSurvey/LimeSurvey.</div>

It is necessary to meet a minimal set of requirements in order to install LimeSurvey on your computer (for development purposes) or on your server. Read our [[Installation – LimeSurvey CE|installation guideline]] for an exhaustive guide on how to install LimeSurvey.

However, for users who may find the installation process too complex and who do not have knowledge of server administration, [https://www.limesurvey.org/ LimeSurvey GmbH] offers [https://www.limesurvey.org/en/pricing Cloud hosting services].

=What do I need?=

There is a lot of information to grasp. We are completely aware of this and you might feel a bit overwhelmed. 
We suggest you do a '''cost-benefit analysis'''. Some aspects that are worth taking into consideration:
*'''Capital:''' Think of the costs of running a server for example. Even though a lot of low-cost hosting providers can be found online, take into account that you have to take care not only of your LimeSurvey installation, but also of the server configuration. If you want to create more complex surveys and/or install/create additional plugins, employees with knowledge in PHP, HTML, CSS will be needed - which means higher costs for you and your business.
*'''Human resources''': If complex surveys are created, employees with IT-related skills might be needed. That is why it is better (sometimes) to outsource such services. You may use our LimeSurvey Cloud services or the help provided by our official partners.
*'''Time:''' Time is a limited resource. Different time-related constraints (e.g., deadlines, lots of qualitative research requests from your clients, etc.) transform time into an important independent variable that should definitely influence your final decision. 

Think of all your possible needs and available resources before choosing between LimeSurvey Cloud and LimeSurvey CE.

Generally, if you want to use LimeSurvey without any download or configuration, you should choose LimeSurvey Cloud. You can test it freely as long as you want and then purchase one of the subscription plans.  However, if you have a running server infrastructure and want to integrate LimeSurvey into that, take a look at LimeSurvey CE. We also offer great LimeSurvey CE plans to enhance your installation with one-click updates and more custom themes.
