“Q: I have four bike racers start a race and travel an average of 30mph. They each race for 2hrs. Is the total number of miles ridden by all riders greater than 200?

A: Reasoning-Each rider will ride 30mph x 2hrs = 60 miles. I have four riders. Therefore, the total number of miles ridden by the riders is 4 x 60 miles = 240 miles.

Answer — YES

Q: I have a staging process for a bike race to line up racers. It takes 47s to stage a group of 8 riders and 67s to get the group to the starting gate and ready to race. I want a new group to start the race every 30s. Do I need 8 groups staged at all times in order to have races continually starting every 30s?

A: Reasoning — Each group takes 47s+67s = 114s to be ready to race. In order to race every 30s, I will need to calculate how many races will need to run before a group is ready to race. A group will have 114s/30s = 3.8 races run before it is ready to race. I can’t have a partial group, so I need to round up to 4. I only need 4 groups staged to be able to race every 30s, so I do not need 8 groups.

Answer — NO
