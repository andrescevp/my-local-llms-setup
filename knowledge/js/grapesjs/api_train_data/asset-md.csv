For instance, if `src` is not a valid URL, throw an informative error.\n4. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive comments and documentation for the Asset class methods to clarify usage and expectations for future developers.\n5. **Unit Testing**: Consider creating a suite of unit tests to cover various scenarios for the Asset class, ensuring that methods function correctly under different conditions.\n6. **Method Performance**: As the Asset class may be frequently instantiated, consider the performance implications of method implementations, ensuring they execute efficiently, especially if they will handle large data sets.\n7. **Extensibility**: Design the class keeping extensibility in mind, allowing for future additions to asset properties (like size, creation date, etc.) without breaking existing functionality.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/api,1.0,train
