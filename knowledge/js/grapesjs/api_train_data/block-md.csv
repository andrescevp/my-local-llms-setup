A well-chosen icon enhances the user experience by offering instant recognition of functionality.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst iconRepresentedBlock = {\n  label: 'Icon Block',\n  content: '<div>Content Here</div>',\n  media: '<svg>...</svg>' // Choose an appropriate icon\n};\n```\nBy being mindful of these considerations, developers can ensure that the media property enhances usability while aligning with overall design principles.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/api,1.0,train
