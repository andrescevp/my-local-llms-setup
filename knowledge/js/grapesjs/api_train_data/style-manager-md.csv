"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What strategies can be used to ensure the Style Manager remains efficient as projects scale?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To ensure the Style Manager remains efficient as projects scale, consider implementing the following strategies:\n1. **Modular Design**: Keep the style definitions modular by grouping styles into sectors for different functionalities, allowing better management as the codebase grows.\n2. **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for styles or sectors that are not immediately needed, which can optimize performance by reducing the initial load time.\n3. **Streamlined Property Definitions**: Reduce redundancy in property definitions. Use built-in methods like `getBuiltIn` to reference common styles rather than duplicating definitions throughout sectors.\n4. **Event Throttling**: When listening for events that trigger updates, implement throttling mechanisms to prevent performance issues by limiting the rate at which events can trigger updates.\n5. **Clear Documentation**: Maintain updated documentation to guide developers and users on how to best utilize the Style Manager as project complexity increases, ensuring that everyone understands the structure and functionality.\nBy applying these strategies, the efficiency and maintainability of the Style Manager can be preserved even in large-scale projects, leading to smoother workflows and better design consistency.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/api,1.0,train
