It can optionally accept an `opts` object with settings such as `useType`, which when set to `true`, will ensure the return type is based on the trait type. Here's an example:\n```javascript\nconst myTrait = new Trait({ id: 'my-checkbox', changeProp: true });\nmyTrait.setValue(true);\nconsole.log(myTrait.getValue()); // Output: true (if changeProp is enabled)\n```""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/api,1.0,train

Here is how you can use `setValue`:\n```javascript\nconst myTrait = new Trait({ id: 'my-text-trait' });\nmyTrait.setValue('New Value');\nconsole.log(myTrait.getValue()); // Output: 'New Value'\n``` \nIf you want to ensure the change isn\u2019t stored in the UndoManager, you can pass: \n```javascript\nmyTrait.setValue('Another Value', { partial: true });\n```""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/api,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the significance of the changeProp property in a Trait?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""The `changeProp` property in a Trait determines how the trait value should be applied to the associated component. If `changeProp` is set to `true`, any value changes made through the trait will update the component\u2019s properties directly. Conversely, if it is set to `false`, the updates will affect the component's attributes instead. This property is significant because it allows for more flexibility in how traits interact with components, enabling traits to either modify attributes or properties based on what makes more sense for the specific case in your application. For example:\n```javascript\nconst myTrait = new Trait({ changeProp: true });\nmyTrait.setValue('somePropertyValue');\nconsole.log(myTrait.getValue()); // value sourced from component properties\n```""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/api,1.0,train
