This practice not only avoids CSS conflicts but also makes your styles more manageable and understandable.\n4. **Testing**: Always test your custom styles across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and that the modal displays as expected everywhere.\n5. **Responsiveness**: Consider implementing responsive styles for your modals to ensure they look good on various screen sizes.

When a modal opens, focus should automatically shift to it, and when it closes, focus should return to the triggering element.\n3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Implement keyboard navigation support. Users should be able to close the modal using the Escape key and navigate through interactive elements within the modal using Tab and Shift+Tab.\n4. **Avoid Overuse**: Use modals judiciously to avoid overwhelming users. Too many modals can create confusion and poor user experience. Reserve them for important information or actions that require user input.\n5. **Responsive Design**: Make sure your modals work well on different screen sizes.
