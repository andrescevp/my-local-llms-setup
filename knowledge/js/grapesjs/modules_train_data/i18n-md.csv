"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How does the generated strings mechanism work in GrapesJS when using I18n?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""In GrapesJS, not all strings are explicitly defined in the locale files, as some strings may be generated based on element `id`s, `name`s, or other specifications. For example, examining a path in the `en` locale file shows a `properties` key within objects such as `styleManager`: \n```js\nstyleManager: {\n    properties: {\n        // 'float': 'Float',\n    },\n},\n```\n\nThis `properties` object is used for translating the names of properties in the Style Manager. If a developer needs to customize these auto-generated names, they can add an `addMessages` call as follows:\n```js\neditor.I18n.addMessages({\n  en: {\n    styleManager: {\n      properties: {\n        'margin-top': 'Top',\n        'margin-right': 'Right',\n        'margin-left': 'Left',\n        'margin-bottom': 'Bottom',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\nThis allows for flexibility in defining how properties are named within the Style Manager, enhancing usability.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/modules,1.0,train

Thus, if you are attempting to update strings after rendering, you might not see any changes unless additional measures are implemented to trigger a re-render or refresh of those elements.
