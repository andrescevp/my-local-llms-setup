"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What is the process of creating a basic plugin in GrapesJS?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Creating a basic plugin in GrapesJS involves defining a function that adds blocks or other features when the editor initializes. First, you create a JavaScript function that takes the editor instance as a parameter. Within this function, you use the GrapesJS API to add blocks or other components. Here\u2019s a brief example:\n\n```js\nfunction myPlugin(editor) {\n  // Use the API to add a simple block\n  editor.Blocks.add('my-first-block', {\n    label: 'Simple block',\n    content: '<div class=\""my-block\"">This is a simple block</div>',\n  });\n}\n\nconst editor = grapesjs.init({\n  container: '#gjs',\n  plugins: [myPlugin],\n});\n```\nIn this code snippet, `myPlugin` is the plugin function that adds a new block labeled \""Simple block\"" with specific HTML content when the editor starts.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/modules,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain the difference between named and non-named plugins in GrapesJS?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Named plugins in GrapesJS are specifically registered under a unique name using `grapesjs.plugins.add`. This name must be unique across all loaded plugins, which helps avoid conflicts. A plugin can be executed in the editor by referencing its name within the `plugins` array.\n\nExample of defining a named plugin:\n```js\nexport default grapesjs.plugins.add('my-plugin-name', (editor, options) => {\n  // Plugin logic here\n});\n```\n\nNon-named plugins are simple functions that can be directly passed into the `plugins` array without being registered under a specific name. This makes them more flexible and easier to manage if you do not need to reference the plugin by name. Here\u2019s an example of a non-named plugin:\n```js\nconst myPlugin = editor => {\n  // Plugin logic here\n};\nconst editor = grapesjs.init({\n  container: '#gjs',\n  plugins: [myPlugin],\n});\n```\nIn summary, named plugins require unique identification and can be more structured, while non-named plugins remain purely functional and less restrictive.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/modules,1.0,train
"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""How do you pass custom options to plugins in GrapesJS?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""To pass custom options to plugins in GrapesJS, you can utilize the `pluginsOpts` object in the configuration of the editor.
