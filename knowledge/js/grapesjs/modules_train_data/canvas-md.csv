"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you explain the different types of built-in canvas spots and their purposes?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""GrapesJS provides several built-in canvas spot types, each serving a distinct purpose:\n1. **Select Type**: Displays the toolbar for the currently selected component. It provides quick access to options and actions available for that component. Example of getting toolbar items:\n   ```js\n   const toolbarItems = editor.getSelected().toolbar;\n   ```\n\n2. **Resize Type**: Allows users to resize components based on their resizable options. This facilitates intuitive manipulation of component dimensions. Example:\n   ```js\n   const resizable = editor.getSelected().resizable;\n   ```\n\n3. **Target Type**: Highlights areas where components can be dragged and dropped. It visually indicates the potential placement of new components and assists in organizing the layout effectively.\n   ```css\n   .gjs-placeholder.horizontal {\n     border-color: transparent red;\n   }\n   .gjs-placeholder.vertical {\n     border-color: red transparent;\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Hover Type**: Highlights components when hovered over, showing the component's name to enhance user feedback during design. Example of retrieving the component name:\n   ```js\n   const name = editor.getSelected().getName();\n   ```\n\n5. **Spacing Type**: Displays visual offsets for components, including paddings and margins. This assists users in understanding spacing dynamics within their layout.\nThese built-in types greatly improve the user experience by providing responsive feedback and assistance while designing with GrapesJS.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/modules,1.0,train

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""Can you provide a code snippet demonstrating how to create a custom canvas spot?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Certainly! Below is an example of how to create a custom canvas spot using GrapesJS. In this example, we will reuse the built-in `hover` canvas spot to create a custom spot that displays a button when a text component is selected.\n\n### Code Snippet:\n```js\neditor.onReady(() => {\n  const { Canvas } = editor;\n  // Listen for the component toggle event\n  editor.on('component:toggled', (component) => {\n    // Remove existing custom spots\n    Canvas.removeSpots({ type: 'my-text-spot' });\n\n    if (component === editor.getSelected() && component.is('text')) {\n      // Add a new custom spot if a text component is selected\n      Canvas.addSpot({ type: 'my-text-spot', component });\n    }\n  });\n\n  // Append the custom spots container to the canvas on ready\n  Canvas.getSpotsEl().appendChild(this.$el);\n});\n```\n### Explanation:\nIn this snippet:\n- We listen for when components are toggled, checking if the selected component is of type 'text'.\n- If so, we remove any previously created custom spots of type 'my-text-spot' and add a new one related to the current selected text component.\n- Once the editor is ready, we append the custom spots element into the canvas area, ensuring it's displayed correctly.

"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What styles can be applied to the custom canvas spots?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""When creating custom canvas spots in GrapesJS, you can apply a variety of CSS styles to ensure they are visually distinct and functionally effective. Here\u2019s a brief overview of styles you might consider:\n\n1. **Positioning and Display**: \n   Set the position of the custom spot to allow it to overlay on the component accurately, such as using `absolute` positioning. For example:\n   ```css\n   .spot-text-btn {\n       position: absolute;\n       left: 50%;\n       bottom: 0;\n       translate: -50% 120%;\n   }\n   ```\n2. **Visibility**: \n   Ensure the custom spots are easily visible, perhaps through contrast:\n   ```css\n   .spot-hover {\n       border: 2px solid #d23be3;\n   }\n   ```\n3. **Interactivity**: \n   To enable interaction with elements such as buttons within the custom spots, ensure pointer events are active. For instance:\n   ```css\n   .spot-text-btn {\n       pointer-events: auto;\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Customization**: \n   You can apply background colors, padding, margins, and rounding.\n   Example:\n   ```css\n   .spot-hover-tag {\n       background-color: #d23be3;\n       color: white;\n       padding: 4px 8px;\n       border-radius: 3px;\n       white-space: nowrap;\n   }\n   ```\nUsing these styles strategically allows you to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interaction layer on top of your Canvas spots.""}]",knowledge/js/grapesjs/modules,1.0,train
