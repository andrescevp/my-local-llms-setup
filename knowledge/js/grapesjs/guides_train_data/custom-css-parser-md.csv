Use logical class names and avoid CSS that could clash with GrapesJS's internal styles.\n3. **Performance**: Validate that your CSS does not negatively affect the performance of the GrapesJS editor. Large stylesheets or many custom rules can impact loading and preview times.\n4. **Testing Across Browsers**: Thoroughly test your templates in different browsers and versions to ensure that the behavior is consistent and the design retains integrity across platforms.\n5. **Compatibility**: Make sure that any custom properties or values follow the latest CSS specifications and are supported by the target browsers.
