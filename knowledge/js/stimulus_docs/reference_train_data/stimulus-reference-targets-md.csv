This interoperability is crucial for several reasons:\n1. **Shared State Management**: When controllers can access shared targets, they can coordinate actions and maintain consistency in application state, ensuring that UI components respond correctly to user inputs across controllers.\n2. **Improved Modularity**: Controllers designed to work well together can lead to a more modular and flexible application architecture, making it easier to maintain and scale over time.\n3. **Reduced Redundancy**: Effective coordination reduces repeated code across controllers, allowing for cleaner implementation and preventing bugs related to stale or inconsistent states.\nOverall, fostering interoperability leads to a more coherent application structure, enhancing user experience and developer productivity.""}]",knowledge/js/stimulus_docs/reference,1.0,train
