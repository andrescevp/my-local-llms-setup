"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What approach does Stimulus take for managing state compared to contemporary frameworks?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Stimulus takes a unique approach to managing state by keeping it as attributes within the DOM elements rather than in JavaScript state variables. Unlike contemporary frameworks that treat the DOM as a write-only target usually populated by JavaScript, Stimulus allows controllers to be largely stateless. This means the application's state is more easily accessible and modifiable directly through HTML elements, enabling automatic behavior linkage without needing explicit initializations.""}]",knowledge/js/stimulus_docs/handbook,1.0,train

The controller maintains a method call, `showCurrentSlide()`, that determines which slide is visible based on the current index. When a user interacts with navigation buttons (Next and Previous), the index is incremented or decremented respectively, and `showCurrentSlide()` is called to update the view to reflect this change.
