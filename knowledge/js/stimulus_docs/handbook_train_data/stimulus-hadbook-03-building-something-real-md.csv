Here\u2019s how to implement a Copy to Clipboard button using Stimulus:\n\n1. **Create HTML Structure**: Start by defining the HTML structure with a text input and a button:\n   ```html\n   <div data-controller=\""clipboard\"">\n     PIN: <input data-clipboard-target=\""source\"" type=\""text\"" value=\""1234\"" readonly>\n     <button data-action=\""clipboard#copy\"">Copy to Clipboard</button>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n2. **Set Up the Controller**: Create a new Stimulus controller file `src/controllers/clipboard_controller.js`:\n   ```js\n   import { Controller } from \""@hotwired/stimulus\"";\n   \n   export default class extends Controller {\n     static targets = [\""source\""];\n     \n     copy(event) {\n       event.preventDefault();\n       navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.sourceTarget.value);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   In this code:\n   - We import the Controller class from Stimulus.\n   - Define `static targets` to access the input element.\n   - Implement the `copy()` method to handle copying the text to the clipboard.\n\n3. **Add Event Listener**: The `data-action` attribute on the button links a user action (click) to the `copy` method in our controller.\n\n4. **Test the Implementation**: Load the application in your browser.
