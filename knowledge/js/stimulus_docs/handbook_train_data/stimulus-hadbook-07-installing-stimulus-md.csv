For example, a file named `clipboard_controller.js` maps to `data-controller=\""clipboard\""`.\n\n4. **Nest your controllers**: You can also namespace your controllers by placing them in subfolders, where each forward slash in the file path translates to two dashes in the identifier. For instance, `users/list_item_controller.js` would be accessible as `data-controller=\""users--list-item\""`.\nThis method helps keep your code organized while allowing easy integration with HTML.""}]",knowledge/js/stimulus_docs/handbook,1.0,train
