"[{""from"": ""human"", ""value"": ""What advantages does Stimulus offer to developers building modern web applications?""}, {""from"": ""gpt"", ""value"": ""Stimulus offers several advantages to developers building modern web applications, including:\n1. **Ease of Use**: Stimulus is designed to be easy to learn, making it accessible for developers of all skill levels, allowing quick integration and effective use without deep knowledge of JavaScript.\n2. **Lightweight**: As a minimalistic framework, Stimulus enhances HTML with JavaScript without the heaviness of larger frameworks, keeping applications fast.\n3. **Separation of Concerns**: Stimulus promotes a clear separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making the codebase cleaner, more manageable, and improving maintainability.\n4. **Compatibility**: It works well with existing client-side libraries and frameworks (like Rails), allowing for easy integration into various project types while improving interactivity.\n5. **Supporting Progressive Enhancement**: Stimulus allows pages to remain functional even if JavaScript is disabled, adhering to progressive enhancement principles. This approach focuses on ensuring that core functionalities are not reliant solely on JS frameworks.""}]",knowledge/js/stimulus_docs/handbook,1.0,train
